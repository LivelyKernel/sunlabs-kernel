    <span style=color:red><b>Note</b>: At this point, the Lively
    Kernel runs well only in the Safari 3.0 web browser.  With all
    the other web browsers, you may still experience various bugs and unusual
    behavior.</span>
    <p>

    The <i>Sun Labs Lively Kernel</i> is a new web programming environment
    developed at Sun Microsystems Laboratories.  The Lively Kernel supports
    desktop-style applications with rich graphics and direct manipulation
    capabilities, but without the installation or upgrade hassles that
    conventional desktop applications have.  The system is written
    entirely in the JavaScript programming language, a language supported
    by all the web browsers, with the intent that the system can run
    in commercial web browsers without installation or any plug-in components.
    The system leverages the dynamic characteristics of the JavaScript language
    to make it possible to create, modify and deploy applications on the fly,
    using tools built into the system itself.  In addition to its
    application execution capabilities, the Lively Kernel can also
    function as an integrated development environment (IDE), making
    the whole system self-sufficient and able to improve and extend itself dynamically.
    
    </p><p>

    </p><h3><a name="motivation">Motivation</a></h3>
    The main goal of the Lively Kernel is to bring the same kind of simplicity, generality and flexibility to web
    programming that we have known in desktop programming for thirty years,
    but without the installation and upgrade hassles than conventional
    desktop applications have.
    </p><p>
    The Lively Kernel places a special emphasis on treating web applications
    as real <i>applications</i>, as opposed to the document-oriented nature of
    most web applications today. In general, we want to put <i>programming</i>
    into web development, as opposed to the current weaving of HTML, XML
    and CSS documents that is also sometimes referred to as programming.
    </p><p>
    A key difference between the Lively Kernel and other systems in the same area 
    is our focus on <i>uniformity</i>.  Our goal is to build a platform
    using a minimum number of underlying technologies.  This is in contrast
    with many current web technologies that utilize a diverse array of
    technologies such as HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, PHP, XML, and so on.
    In the Lively Kernel we attempt to do as much as possible using a 
    single technology: <i>JavaScript</i>. We have chosen JavaScript primarily
    because of its ubiquitous availability in the web browsers today
    and because of its syntactic similarity to other highly popular
    languages such as C, C++ and Java.  However, we also want to leverage
    the dynamic aspects of JavaScript, especially the ability to modify
    applications at runtime. Such capabilities are an essential ingredient
    in building a malleable web programming environment that allows
    applications to be developed interactively and collaboratively.

    </p><h3><a name="infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></h3>
    The Lively Kernel runs in 
    <a href="#supported">supported web browsers</a> without installation
    or any plug-in components whatsoever.  
    The system utilizes the JavaScript engine, graphics capabilities
    and asynchronous networking features that are already available
    in commercial web browsers today.  In general, one of our goals
    has been to leverage existing technologies as much as possible.
    </p><p>
    A unique feature of the Lively Kernel is a graphics
    library called <i>Morphic</i>.  Morphic is a user interface
    framework that supports composable graphical objects,
    along with the machinery required to display and animate these
    objects, handle user inputs, and manage underlying system resources
    such as displays, fonts and color maps.  A key goal of Morphic
    is to make it easy to construct and edit interactive graphical objects,
    both by direct manipulation and from within programs.
    The Morphic user interface framework was originally developed for the 
    <a href="http://research.sun.com/self/">Self</a> system
    at Sun Labs, but it later became popular also as part of
    the <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a> Smalltalk programming
    environment.
    The Lively Kernel brings the flexibility and power of Morphic 
    also to JavaScript developers and to web application development in general.
    </p><p>

    </p><h3><a name="features">Main features</a></h3>
    The main features of the Lively Kernel include:
    </p><p>
    <ul><li>
    <it>Small web programming environment and computing kernel, 
    written entirely with JavaScript</it>. In addition to its application 
    execution capabilities, the platform can also function as 
    an <i>integrated development environment (IDE)</i>, making the 
    whole system self-contained and able to improve and 
    extend itself on the fly. 
    </li>
    <li>
    <it>Programmatic access to the user interface</it>. Our system provides
    programmatic access from JavaScript to the user interface via the
    Morphic user interface framework.  The user interface is built around
    an event-based programming model familiar to most web developers. 
    </li>
    <li>
    <it>Asynchronous networking</it>.  As in Ajax, you can use asynchronous HTTP
    to perform all the network operations asynchronously, without
    blocking the user interface. 
    </li>
    </ul>

    </p><h3><a name="using">What can you do with it?</a></h3>
    The Lively Kernel allows you to do pretty much everything
    that you would expect to do in a conventional desktop
    programming environment.  The main difference is that 
    in the Lively Kernel everything takes place in a web browser.
    </p><p>
    Utilizing the features described above, you can build conventional,
    desktop-style applications that run on the web.  Utilizing the 
    capabilities of the Morphic user interface framework, you can
    also build desktop-like environments and systems in which numerous
    applications and widgets run simultaneously in a regular web browser.

    </p><h3><a name="getit">How do I get it?</a></h3>
    The Sun Labs Lively Kernel is alive on the web, meaning that you do not 
    download it or install it. If your browser supports the Lively Kernel 
    (see the list of <a href="#supported">supported web browsers</a> below), 
    then merely clicking on the <i>Enter Lively Kernel</i> link causes the 
    system to come to life in your computer. You may see some static elements 
    on the screen but, by default, everything there is alive and changeable.

    </p><h3><a name="understand">Where is the source code or binaries?</a></h3>
    The entirety of the Lively Kernel is written in JavaScript, a dynamic language 
    that uses no binary files for execution. The Lively Kernel does not require any 
    installation or plug-ins, since the necessary JavaScript engine is already 
    part of your web browser. As soon as you click on a link to start the system,
    all the Lively  Kernel code is loaded into your browser and running.
    At some point we may compress the files to make for faster startup but,
    if so, we will still make the full uncompressed sources available on this site.
    </p><p>
    For your convenience, we have made the source code available here as a
    <A HREF="LivelyKernel-SourceCode-0.7.zip">ZIP file</A>.

    </p><h3><a name="supported">Supported web browsers</a></h3>
    The Lively Kernel is intended to run in every commercial web browser client 
    with no plug-ins or installation whatsoever. However, because of differences 
    in the underlying graphics and other capabilities of various web browsers, 
    we only support a limited set of browsers and browser versions.
    Currently, we have tested our system on Windows XP and MacOS
    using the following browsers:
    <ul>  
        <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Safari 3.0.3 public beta release</a> (<b><span style=color:red>recommended</span></b> for best performance and quality of experience)
        <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/3.0a8/releasenotes/">Firefox 3.0 alpha release</a> (still various bugs left)
        <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Firefox 2.0.0.7</a> (still various bugs left)
    </ul>
    The browsers above provide support for 
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</a>,
    a graphics library that we use as the underlying low level graphics interface.
    The SVG interfaces are hidden from the application developer,
    but our implementation requires an SVG-compatible graphics engine. 
    To end users and developers, the Lively Kernel is an environment that
    is based purely on JavaScript, not SVG.</p><p>
    <b>IMPORTANT!</b> The Lively Kernel requires SVG support and does <b>not</b> 
    currently run on Microsoft Internet Explorer.  We are hoping to have support
    for Microsoft Internet Explorer available soon.

    </p><h3><a name="caution"><span style=color:red>Caution</span></a></h3>
    The Sun Labs Lively Kernel is research software.  It may be remarkable in 
    various ways, but it is not production software.  
    Rather, it is an experimental system for turning the web as we know it 
    into a universe of objects that are active, accessible, changeable;  
    in short, lively.
    <p>
    We are making the Lively Kernel available as open source software to 
    encourage further exploration by academics and adventurous developers, 
    and we anticipate rapid progress toward future versions of the system 
    that are not only lively but also well-behaved. 
    
    </p><h3><a name="credits">Credits</a></h3>
    The Sun Labs Lively Kernel is the result of a cooperation between four 
    experienced software developers, all frustrated with the state of 
    the web programming practice today:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/people/mybio.php?c=394">Dan Ingalls</a>
        <li><a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~tjm">Tommi Mikkonen</a>
        <li><a href="/people/mybio.php?c=127">Krzysztof Palacz</a>
        <li><a href="/people/mybio.php?c=898">Antero Taivalsaari</a>
    </ul>
    While developing the Lively Kernel, we have received help from various
    other people.  We would especially like to thank Mikko Kuusipalo,
    Kristen McIntyre, Richard Ortiz, Pekka Reijula, and Stephen Uhler 
    for their valuable contributions.  We would also like to thank
    Linda Bohn and Mario Wolczko for their invaluable assistance
    during the project.

    </p><h3><a name="intellectual heritage">Intellectual heritage</a></h3>
    The idea of the Lively Kernel was inspired in part by the success
    of the <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a> Smalltalk
    programming environment.  In this regard, we owe a debt to all
    the people who designed that system.  The specific choice of a
    Morphic-style graphics architecture was inspired by the simplicity
    of such an architecture manifested originally in 
    the <a href="http://research.sun.com/self/">Self</a> system
    and later in the Squeak system.  For historical references,
    refer to the following documents:
