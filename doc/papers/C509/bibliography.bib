@article{Lieberman2006EUD,
        Abstract = {We think that over the next few years, the goal of interactive systems and services will evolve from just making systems easy to use (even though that goal has not yet been completely achieved) to making systems that are easy to develop by end users. By now, most people have become familiar with the basic functionality and interfaces of computers, but they are not able to manage any programming language. Therefore, they cannot develop new applications or modify current ones according to their needs.  In order to address such challenges it is necessary a new paradigm, based on a multidisciplinary approach involving several types of expertise, such as software engineering, human-computer interaction, CSCW, which are now rather fragmented and with little interaction. The resulting methods and tools can provide results useful across many application domains, such as ERP, multi-device services (accessible through both mobile and stationary devices), and professional applications.

        Abstract = {End-user scripting languages are relatively easy to learn, but have limited expressive power. Tile-based scripting systems are particularly accessible to beginners, but usually are very limited in scope and usually lack extensibility, and for some tasks the tile idiom becomes cumbersome. Conventional programming languages used by computer professionals are far more powerful, but at the cost of additional complexity and limited environmental support, which place them out of the casual programmer's reach. This paper presents TileScript, an attempt to combine the accessibility of a tile-based programming interface with the leverage of a full textual programming language and with a simple means of extension, making it potentially an appealing tool for the novice programmer without sacrificing any expressiveness. All TileScript programs, whether built originally with tiles or textually, can always be edited both graphically via a drag-and-drop tile interface and textually, and the user can freely switch back and forth between tile and textual representations at any time. Additionally TileScript's simple yet powerful extensibility mechanisms allow the language to be used to tackle problems that would normally be out of the scope of an end-user scripting language.},
