<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>What is it?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>
The <I>Sun Labs Lively Kernel </I>is a web programming environment and computing
kernel built on the JavaScript language and graphics capabilities
available in ordinary web browsers. JavaScript brings the graphics to
life, and the graphics are then composed into an interactive
application platform. In addition to its application execution
capabilities, the platform can also function as an IDE (integrated
development environment), making the whole system self-contained and
able to improve and extend itself on the fly. The Lively Kernel includes
the ability to save on web pages the applications built with it, and
even new versions of the system itself.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>How did it
come to be?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>It
began as a study of web programming.  A group of us at Sun Labs had
surveyed the field and we felt that web programming was much more
complicated than it needed to be. When we looked at the lash-ups of
HTML, DOM, CSS, PHP and all the AJAX web toolkits, they seemed
unnecessarily complex and cumbersome compared to the desktop
programming environments that we were familiar with already years ago
before the web.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>It
seemed to us that if, instead of starting with a text markup
language, you began with a dynamic language and structured graphics
like desktops systems of the 1980's, then even web-based applications
could be just as lively and interactive as the best desktop software.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>Beyond
just rethinking web programming, the Lively Kernel has become a
rethinking of the web itself. It offers a world of lively objects,
all active and distributed throughout the universe of the web.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Can anybody
use it?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>Anyone
can probably have some fun with it. The Lively Kernel includes a simple
graphics editor, and many ingredients of a UI builder. There is an
online tutorial, and most features of the system can be tried out
while you are reading.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>That
said, it must be understood that the Lively Kernel is an experiment and a
research environment in its early stages, and at this point it is
probably more appropriate for students, computing enthusiasts and
even children than for, e.g., commercial web site designers.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>How do I get
it?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>
The Sun Labs Lively Kernel is alive on the web, meaning that you do not
download it and install it. If your browser supports the Lively Kernel
(see the list of supported browsers below), then merely clicking on
the &ldquo;Enter Lively Kernel&rdquo; link causes the system to come
to life in your computer. You may see some static items on the screen
but, by default, everything there is alive and changeable.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>I don't
understand. Where is the source code or binaries?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>The
entirety of the Lively Kernel is written in JavaScript, a dynamic
language that uses no binary files for execution. The Lively Kernel does
not require any installation or plug-ins, since the necessary
JavaScript engine is already part of your web browser. As soon as you
click on &ldquo;Enter Lively Kernel&rdquo; link, all the Lively
Kernel code is loaded into your browser and running. At some point we
may compress the files to make for faster startup but, if so, we will
make the full uncompressed sources available on this site.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>For
your convenience, we have made the source code available here as a 
<A HREF="LivelyKernel-SourceCode-0.8.zip">ZIP file</A>.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Is the Sun Labs
Lively Kernel open source?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>Yes,
the Sun Labs Lively Kernel is made available from Sun Microsystems
Laboratories as open source software under the GPL license, version
2.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>What is the
GPL license?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>In
layman's terms, the GPL license says that individuals may use the
software for their own use without charge, companies may use it for
their own use without charge, and individuals and companies may even
build products based on the Lively Kernel for sale without charge. The
only requirement (the so-called &quot;copy left&quot; condition) is
that if an individual or company wishes to distribute the software
with changes or enhancements, then those changes or enhancements must
be made available back to the Open Source community. For further
information, refer to <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</A>.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>What if a
company wants to build a product around the Lively Kernel, but does not
want to reveal proprietary enhancements?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>Sun
Microsystems, as licensor of the Lively Kernel, may negotiate alternative
proprietary licenses with such developers. Interested parties should
contact Sun Microsystems for further information.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-before: always"><FONT SIZE=2><B>How
is the Sun Labs Lively Kernel related to JavaScript?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>
The Lively Kernel is written entirely in the JavaScript programming language.
Lively Kernel applications are also written entirely in JavaScript.
We call it &quot;Lively&quot; because the system makes the browser
far more interactive and alive. The applications and even those
scripts that comprise the Lively Kernel system itself can be examined
and changed at will by the user.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Why do you
call it a &ldquo;Kernel&rdquo;?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>We
call it a kernel for three reasons: First, the system is still
reasonably small &ndash; less than ten thousand lines of JavaScript
code. Second, the system is intended to be self-contained and
extensible, meaning that it is possible to enhance the capabilities
of the system dramatically using only the system itself. Third, the
system exhibits various operating system like qualities, such as the
ability to run multiple applications simultaneously and to serve as a
host for entirely new types of applications, widgets and tools that
were not pre-built into the system itself. In general, one of the
central characteristics of the Lively Kernel is its <I>malleability</I>:
An imaginative user can take the Lively Kernel in directions that were
entirely unforeseen by its designers. In that sense, the current
system is only a &ldquo;kernel&rdquo; of its full potential.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>What is the
graphics model in the Lively Kernel?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>The
design is inspired by the <I>Morphic </I>graphics framework
originally built in the <I>Self</I> programming system
(<A HREF="http://research.sun.com/self/">http://research.sun.com/self/</A>),
and later incorporated into the <I>Squeak</I> Smalltalk environment
(<A HREF="http://www.squeak.org/">http://www.squeak.org/</A>). It is
a desktop-style graphics architecture supporting superposition,
transformation, clipping and other useful graphical traits and
operations, as well as a multi-user event model.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Whoa! What
do you mean, multi-user?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>The
hand metaphor used for the cursor in the Lively Kernel allows for several
users to actively inhabit a single world at the same time. We had
this working in an earlier version, and plan to make it work in the
release version as soon as possible. The objects are serialized at
times of change, very much the way they are serialized to store a web
page. The performance is not optimized, and the synchronization is
not as rigorous as systems like <a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/">Croquet</a>, and yet it has shown itself
to be practical for simple applications like a multi-user whiteboard
and simple shared games.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Where does
the Lively Kernel run?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>
The Lively Kernel is intended to run in every commercial web browser client with
no plug-ins or installation whatsoever. However, the system uses
advanced features that are only now appearing in web browsers. 
Because of differences in the underlying graphics capabilities of the various web
browsers, currently the system runs best on Apple's Safari browser. It also
runs on Firefox, although with less performance and with some
remaining bugs. Microsoft Internet Explorer is not supported
currently, but we are hoping to support it in the near future.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Why doesn't
the Lively Kernel run on Microsoft Internet Explorer?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>Unfortunately,
the graphics libraries supported by different web browsers are still
incompatible. Safari, Firefox and Opera have support for a graphics
standard called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), while Microsoft
Internet Explorer supports VML (Vector Markup Language). Currently,
we have a public Lively Kernel implementation available only for
those browsers that support SVG. We are hoping to have support for
Microsoft Internet Explorer available soon.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>What is SVG?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>SVG
stands for <I>Scalable Vector Graphics</I>. It is a declarative
graphics language and specification designed by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C). It is supported by most web browsers, although the
implementations are still somewhat incompatible. While SVG is
commonly used via its HTML-like declarative syntax, the SVG
functionality of a web browser can also be accessed programmatically
from JavaScript.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>How
dependent is the Lively Kernel on SVG?</B></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>To
us, SVG is an implementation vehicle. We have chosen to use SVG
because of its functionality and widespread availability in
commercial web browsers. However, to end users and developers, the Lively
Kernel is an environment that is based purely on JavaScript. At that
level, the use of SVG or any other implementation technology is not
intended to be visible at all. Future releases of the Lively Kernel may
include back-ends also for other graphics standards than SVG.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>What exact
browser versions currently support the Lively Kernel?</B></FONT></P>
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>Safari
&ndash; 3.0 public beta release (<span style=color:red><b>RECOMMENDED</b></span>)</FONT></P></A>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>Note:
On Firefox and Opera our system still has various bugs. Performance is also
rather poor on Firefox 2.0.</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>For
best performance and quality of experience, we highly recommend
Safari.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Why is the performance
of the system poor sometimes?</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=2>The
performance of the Lively Kernel is heavily dependent on the performance
of the JavaScript virtual machine and the SVG engine inside your web
browser. Neither JavaScript virtual machines nor SVG engines have
been optimized for executing significant, long-running web
applications yet. However, based on our earlier experience with other
dynamic languages, these problems should go away soon. For instance,
there is no reason for a JavaScript application to run any slower
than a comparable Smalltalk application (Smalltalk is an equally
dynamic programming language), or significantly slower than a
comparable Java application. It is just that JavaScript virtual
machines have not been optimized for high performance yet. In the
near future, web browsers will likely have JavaScript engines and
graphics libraries with dramatically better performance.</FONT></P>
