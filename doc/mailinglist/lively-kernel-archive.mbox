Folks -

As many of you know, we are migrating the focus of our communication 
from the earlier forum mechanism to a simple group mailing list.

Begging your pardon, I am sending this message to test the reply 
behavior of the list.  The plan is that all replies to the list will 
be broadcast to all members.  If you wish to make a private reply, 
you must take care to specify your recipient in the to: field.  Also, 
at least for now, this list will truncate messages greater than 80k 
in length.

Once we have some of this administrivia out of the way, I hope to 
send out a summary of current activities, release plans, etc.  Please 
stay tuned.

	- Dan Ingalls

Subject: [General] [ANN] HTML Layout and Rendering Engine and a Form Editor
	for Morphic
Message-ID: <7D02C846-46A8-4454-8DAA-B4C45ABEB942@altmobile.com>
Status: O

Hi and thanks for making programming fun again.



I wanted to announce that over the holiday I wrote a layout and  
rendering engine for both HTML and XML content. Well it was really on  
Christmas day and it's not a WYSWYG tool but, it does enable some cool  
stuff. The background to this is that my company builds Web 2.0 mash- 
up tools and servers and we wanted to support Lively Kernel as a  
deployment client much as we support Apple Dashboard Widgets,  
Microsoft Vista Gadgets, Adobe AIR, Opera Widgets, etc.

So this is what's done so far:


1. Transform HTML to Morphic widgets. It seems that a goal of Morphic  
is to create a unified object environment hosted in a browser without  
using HTML UIs. Unfortunately, outside of the enterprise all of the  
useful data comes from the web in the form of HTML. Even RSS feeds  
contain HTML payloads. So unless we are going to shun the web as a  
primary data source or just asString/toString()/textContent() these  
data sources, we need to be able to intelligently and dynamically  
transform HTML elements such as paragraphs, lists, images, and tables  
to Morphic widgets. And of course, once they're in Morphic users/ 
developers can create magic.

With this as the underlying justification/premise, I created a simple  
to use API:


* Node.prototype.renderInMorphic = function(morphicContainer)

This is the entry point for rendering HTML elements in Morphic.  
Implemented in the XML DOM, the assumption is that users will use XHR  
to retrieve snippets of HTML and not hugely complex web pages. Our  
Dynamic Mashup Server can dynamically fix broken HTML and serve it up  
as XML. Nonetheless, there's some sample code on how to import HTML  
into this function to deal with raw HTML elements.

Once again, my goal is to enable snippets of HTML to be renderable in  
Morphic and not reimplement an HTML browser in Morphic. Web 2.0-type  
widgets is what I'm supporting even though, the code can be expanded  
to support full HTML pages.


* Element.prototype.renderXMLElementInMorphic = function  
(morphicContainer)

This is the entry point for rendering fill-in-the-blank forms.  
Implemented in the XML DOM, the assumption is that users will use XHR  
to retrieve XML data and want to display and perhaps edit it. For  
example, let's say you have an address book generated from your  
corporate database or IM system and you wanted to display the XML  
content in a structured form. Or, you just have XML data that your  
want to edit. Currently, I haven't built support for flipping through  
collections of XML elements but that's not too hard.

It currently supports both attribute centric document (such as <name  
first='Joe' last='Public'/>) as well as element centric documents  
(such as <name><first>Joe</first><last>Public</last></name>) as well  
as a "Submit" button that is attached to an XHR to post back to the  
origin server. It's _not_ hooked into Morphic models as I needed more  
documentation on it and wanted to get the developers/community feedback.


The following are the supporting functions used by the  
renderInMorphic() function:

*Element.prototype.renderTABLE = function (morphicContainer)

Though Morphic does not implement a native table widget, this function  
will transform the HTML elements or text contained in the TDs of each  
TR row. The HTML layout engine will line up the Morphic wdgets  into  
corresponding rows. Rather than adopt the standard layout algorithm  
used in HTML, I implemented a layout more representative of how  
developers think heterogeneous widgets should align in a row.

I tested this against homogenous (eg. table of images from a remote  
web site) as well as heterogeneous table data.


*Element.prototype.renderIMG = function (morphicContainer)

This function transforms an IMG into an ImageButtonMorph. The HTML  
attributes SRC, WIDTH, HEIGHT, ALT, and TITLE are implements but  
BORDER is not yet. Since BORDER can be set by CSS or HTML, I wanted to  
comprehensively address CSS parsing but didn't want to use 3rd party  
JS libraries yet so that there was no conflict with the LK.

ALT and TITLE use the unsupported Morphic caption property.

If this IMG is contained by an A link, then an onMouseDown() event  
handler is attached to spawn a new window. This is typical with  
thumbnail image galleries. You should ensure that your browser allows  
popups. I did an alternative implementation that uses a popup DIV  
"window" to circumvent the external window but I wanted to see what  
the developers/community view as appropriate Morphic approach.


*Element.prototype.renderBR = function (morphicContainer)

This function creates a new row in the layout


*Element.prototype.renderEMBED = function (morphicContainer)

This function is implemented to support sound and perhaps other media.  
Our Dynamic Mashup Server can generate text-to-speech for any mash-up  
and it's implemented with HTML EMBED so that's the background. There's  
all these rules about the requirement for sound controls to be visible  
in HTML before being played. I took the easy approach and just launch  
a new window until the developers/community decided on a technique.


*Element.prototype.renderOL = function (morphicContainer)

This function supports both UL and OL element transformations to a  
CheapListMorph iff LI elements contain text and not IMG or other HTML  
elements such as other OL/UL, TABLE, etc. Currently there's no support  
for highly nested lists but a list of images or list of text content  
is supported. Stylized text LI elements will be striped and the text  
will be rendered as TextMorph. Other things such as a list of A links  
is also supported.


*Element.prototype.renderP = function (morphicContainer)

This function transforms HTML text containers such as P, B, H1 to a  
TextMorph. This function uses the helper function isTextContainer().  
The text content is extracted using the DOM's textContent and no style  
information (CSS or HTML) are used since I didn't see a rich text morph.


*Element.prototype.renderA = function (morphicContainer)

This function renders both text and IMG links by transforming to a  
label TextMorph or ImageButtonMorph as appropriate. Of course, style  
information is excluded from the TextMorph. A cute "external" icon is  
placed adjacent to the label since all links spawn a new window.


*Element.prototype.isTextContainer = function()

Used to determine if we should use a TextMorph during transformation.


*Element.prototype.isHTMLElement = function()

This function is used to determine if we perform HTML or XML  
transformations.


*Element.prototype.isBlockLevelElement = function()

This function will be used in the future to by the layout engine


*Element.prototype.isInlineElement = function()

The opposite of isBlockLevelElement()


*Element.prototype.definesCSSDisplayAsBlockLevel = function()

This function will be used in the future to by the layout engine


###

The layout engine is called HTMLLayout in the code even though it's  
really a Morphic layout engine for HTML and XML elements. It defines  
the following functions:

* createNewRow: function ()

* addMorph: function (morph)

* addMorphToRow: function (morph, rowNumber)

* isFirstMorphInCurrentRow: function()

* isFirstMorphInRow: function(rowNumber)

* isFirstMorphInLayout: function()

* getTallestMorphInCurrentRow: function()

* getTallestMorphInRow: function(rowNumber)

* getFirstMorphPostionInNewRow: function()

* getFirstMorphPostionInRow: function(rowNumber)

* getNextMorphPostionInCurrentRow: function()

* getNextMorphPostionInRow: function(rowNumber)

* getNextPositionForElement: function (element)

* getWidestMorphInAllRows: function(morphPosition)

* computeWidthDifference: function (srcMorph, targetMorph)

* shiftMorphsInRow: function (rowNumber, units, xOrY)

* alignMorphInEachRow: function(morphPosition, eastOrWest)



###


As all pre-announcements disappoint, I built this against LK v.7 and  
don't want to delay shipping our commercial products with a port to  
the latest LK v .8 release, if it's needed. So hopefully in next few  
days/weeks all this stuff will be available for general use.

Of course ... very cool.  I naturally wonder about using CouchDb as a  
back-end for this.  Couch only reads and writes JSON documents,  
directly, but allows arbitrary binary content to be saved as  
attachments to those JSON documents.

Hi, Guys -

I'm travelling today (and totally traumatized about changing mailer defaults).  I'm going to leave it this way right now, but I am inclined to make reply to all the default if there are no objections.  So now would be the time to say if you want it left as is or move to reply-to-all.

Hoping to have something even more useful to say shortly

Well, I for one find it less embarrassing to send to someone  
privately what was intended for the list (a mistake which can be  
easily corrected), compared to sending to the list which was meant  
privately (since it is out, you cannot take it back). This and other  
arguments are discussed at:

http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html

So IMHO the current setting is exactly right.

Status: O

Antero Taivalsaari wrote a lovely paper, The Event Horizon User  
Interface Model For Small Devices, about a new kind of zooming system  
involving compress/expand access to unlimited amounts of information  
pushed into or pulled out of a central (white) hole on a small  
display such as a Palm Pilot.

The way it works seems to suggest that no document can exceed a  
quarter of the screen@any one time which is a serious limitation  
in my mind. And it uses compress and expand keys which are operated  
for a duration which has the problems of velocity versus  
displacement. Further, although every item can eventually be seen,  
using this one dimensional access, two dimensional motion is also  
required sometimes.

My notion of an auto-zooming world can be elaborated to include those  
benefits and rather more as well. Let the top of the world contain  
one or more white holes contained in visible circles. Once you  
navigate across that boundary, lets use zooming and dedicate a zoom  
wheel (displacement) to compress and expand from the hole while  
leaving the cursor centered. Then we can navigate to any visible  
object with the effect that the world zooms in to the right level to  
read and operate on that content.

I will leave other feature for future discussions.

Message-ID: <p0623094ac3c92838a753@[192.168.1.101]>
Status: O

Greetings -

We just put out release 0.8 on our main web site:

	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/

Here is a summary of major (and some minor) changes...

1.  The entire Morphic architecture has been converted to wrap host 
SVG objects instead of extending them.  This was done in such a way 
as to change almost nothing@the level of most applications.  The 
major benefit afforded by this change is compatibility, since many 
JavaScript implementations do not support the ability to extend host 
objects.

2.  We have adopted a class system derived from prototype.js ver 1.60 
and extended with built-in support for serialization and copy 
constructors.  These conventions make it much more natural to use 
classes and class inheritance in JavaScript (the .subclass() method 
and $super optional parameter).

3. Some principles of layout have been introduced:  setBounds() has 
been split into setPosition() and setExtent() in anticipation of 
layout managers that will want to move submorphs around without 
having to recompose them internally.  Recomposition is triggered by 
setExtent() via the message adjustForNewBounds().  This is summarized 
in the comment to Morph.setBounds().

4.  An optional menu button has been added to ScrollPanes.  See the 
SimpleBrowser for an example of how to use this feature.

5.  Paned windows and their titleBars are now able to resize 
themselves proportionally (using the rectangle resize handles) 
independent of their ability to grow and shrink using the handles to 
change scale.

6.  We have the beginnings of a reflective model for execution state. 
If one sets Config.debugExtras = true, most methods are wrapped with 
a function that keeps track of the stack with method names *and* even 
the arguments.  This can be tested by, eg, typing
	Function.showStack()
in any textMorph, selecting it and evaluating it with alt-d.  This 
should result in the stack being printed to the console with method 
names and argument values.

7.  This same approach makes it possible to trace code.  This 
capability can be tested by invoking the 'test tracing' option of the 
Morph menu.  Note that this will generate a lot of output if used on 
a complex object.  Best to try it on a simple rectangle or ellipse.

This would appear to be evidence that we only make releases every 3 
months or so.  However this is *not* our intention.  We are planning, 
first of all, to make the more frequent updates on our beta site 
available for anonymous download.  Also we are planning soon to open 
up our working repository, but this will be the topic of another 
message.

Have fun;  report bugs

	- Dan, for the LK team

Dan, as you know, I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing a system that
brings together the strengths of our respective projects. We would
both like to see lightweight, interactively created active content
become as prevalent and easily shared as html text is today. As
section 2 <http://google-caja-discuss.googlegroups.com/web/caja-spec.pdf>
argues, I believe security problems have been the fatal flaw which
killed most previous attempts@active content. Caja gives us a basis
for addressing these security problems. Lively gives authors a medium
for creating active content worth sharing.

However, your recent message has me concerned that Lively is deviating
ever farther from programming patterns that can be secured. Before
making these changes, what thought was given to their possible
compatibility with object-capability security?

Good. The Caja effort has made the same decision regarding DOM and
other conventional browser host objects.

The Caja group has been puzzling over the extent to which Caja can
support the programming patterns that Prototype encourages. Our
conclusions so far are that Class.addMethods can't be rescued, and
that Object.extend is problematic@best. OTOH, Figures 7 and 8 of
<http://google-caja-discuss.googlegroups.com/web/caja-spec.pdf> show
the recommended Cajita inheritance pattern which seems to have all the
virtues of Smalltalk's, including even a proper "super", while
remaining friendly to object-capability principles. See also Figures
14 and 15 for an inheritance pattern that's more familiar to
JavaScript programmers, still Smalltalk-like, and adequately friendly
to object-capability principles.

Are you thereby providing ambient access to the ability to reflect on
one's caller? What security properties do you imagine might survive
the availability of such an operation?

As you heard me say@OOPSLA, Squeak-E failed because Smalltalk code
was not facing a hostile environment, so the Smalltalk community never
became willing to sacrifice anything else they value for the sake of
security. I have no argument with that. If that's the right tradeoff
for Lively, fine. But please make the choice with your eyes open.

Hi, Mark -

Thanks for your candid response.  This is the beginning...

I'm looking forward to this convergence too.  Don't give up...

Zero...

... and therefore we owe you (and the higher value of secure architecture that you represent) an apology for this slight.  Yet we do not feel@all apologetic for the following logic of how we are trying to bootstrap this project...

Our first goal for this project is survival, and it is not a slam dunk by any means.

We are following our intuition regarding a number of sub-goals where we are trying to maximize the impact (/utility/novelty/coolness...) divided by the effort required in each case.  Here are my favorites among those "sweet spots"...

1.  A real (and lively) development environment for JavaScript

2.  A cool demo of "simple things are simple"

3.  A educational playground like EToys for JavaScript

4.  A useful PIM like Hypercard, and able to handle content like our engine demo

5.  Some way to encapsulate arbitrary (not just LK) web content in LK so it becomes
	a mega-malleable mashup framework

6.  A compelling demo of a collaborative web page

7.  A really easy to use application builder along the lines of Fabrik, but with a parts-list
	spreadsheet alternative to wires

My feeling is that if any of these really works, then it/they can carry the project for a while as it matures and gathers interest.


Of course one of these could be,

N.  Demonstrate a Caja-based version with true modularity and security properties,

and another could be,

M.  Rewrite the whole Morphic framework along the lines the Viewpoints folks are exploring with Lessphic(tm) and their simplified outline-based graphic kernel.

The only reason these are not on our list, is that, when it comes down to priorities, we'll first try to get bootstrapped in a manner we understand and can pull off ourselves


Now let me tell the story of the first four Lively Kernels

#1:  Canvas model with  random JavaScript, transcribed from various other (Java) apps

#2:  Morphic architecture on top of Java2D graphics engine

#3:  Morphic on SVG extended by JavaScript

#4:  Morphic on SVG with wrapper API

Wow, there have been four generations already?  That's right, and here is how it has unfolded:  In every case we did an experiment that was a little proof of concept.  We started with #1 around October of 2006.  It was just a year ago that I wrote the first Morphic kernel that gave us #2.  It worked, and so we continued and made it real.  Then in May of last year Krzysztof wrote just enough to demonstrate the Morphic in SVG, and we realized we could run LK with no installation.  There too, we followed the experiment with a full rewrite and moved forward to full SVG.  Then last October we faced the non-portability of our SVG interface, and Krzysztof did another experiment to demonstrate the Morphic kernel running with wrappers (and thus able to run in, eg, Opera or Batik/Squiggle).  Here again, we moved forward with the result knowing that Opera would eventually work, and Batik would allow us to make a plugin for, notably, Internet Explorer.

So, every experiment worked?  No, not really.  There was another one in there between #1 and #2 where we tried integrating everything with Dojo.  Here we did the kernel experiment in a week as usual, but we discovered that Dojo was not lightweight, and was (at least@the time) full of circumlocutions to deal with all the old HTML models and the incompatibilities between browsers, and this simply scared us.


The point is...
LK is relatively small, and you can experiment with new versions in a week or so.  We could help by restructuring a few files to make this inner kernel more apparent.  Basically what is needed is a single world along the lines of the "Simple example morphs" world, and just the classes needed to support it.

And to return@last to your concern, Mark, we should then be able more easily to scrutinize that smaller corpus and actually rewrite it a couple of times as an experiment in Caja.  And this is just the approach we anticipate in the case of the Viewpoints rewrite of Morphic.  We want all these things to happen, we just need to follow our "survival agenda" for a while, and hopefully more folks will join up and help to carry out those other experiments.

In case you haven't seen it, the qooxdoo JavaScript library has an  
interesting class system, described here:

	http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/0.7/class_declaration

While I don't have any practical experience with it, it certainly  
seems 'cleaner' than some of the ad-hoc class-y-ness I've seen in  
other JS frameworks. @least parts of it; 'super' stuff is still  
awkward.

What is the current thought about having a wiki for this stuff? I've  
considered various ways to coordinate content between mailing lists

maintain the advantages of each with all the content made available

it will be fine to require specific browsers for fully functional

The notion of a wiki implemented in Lively Kernel is terminally

Er, did you say document?  ;-)

Seriously, though, perhaps you could help us to produce a relatively
simple guide for first-timers.  I'll take a stab@this in the next day or two,
you can critique it, and then we can move on to the next thing.

If you have not already done so, please do refer to the new Technical
Overview that Antero wrote up just two weeks ago,

	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/LivelyKernel-TechnicalOverview.pdf

If you find that to be useful, then we may want to focus on
improvements to that document, rather than starting something new.

I'm anticipating, though, that you may be after something simpler for first timers;
the kind of thing that would just let you, eg, give a demo and do something really simple.

>Some of the referenced papers are not available without substantial

Well, I hope so.  Morphic is really simple and, if we can't cover it in a page or two,
then something is really wrong.  Again, please critique what's in the Technical
Overview from the standpoint of your needs.

The forums were supposed to remain accessible after we locked them.
I'm now tracking down why they are not.

We, too, want to explore Wiki-like functionality in the Lively Kernel.
Perhaps we can work together on this.  Before it can serve as a
community vehicle, though, we need either

	A way for LK to run in all browsers
	(probably a plugin of some kind)
or
	Some little proxy-projector sort of thing that
	at least lets users of other browsers view the
	content.

Mind you, this needn't inhibit us from exploring life in an LKWiki,
since everyone in the community (sort of by definition ;-)
has found a browser that works.

Hi, Dick -

I believe the forums are now accessible again, at

You should be able to read from them, although they are now locked.

I realize that my previous somewhat flip answer of "Zero" might have you a bit
concerned.  Also, I let my response go in other directions that may have
obscured our very real interest in Caja and serious security for JavaScript.

So far we have made our best progress by small experiments followed by
significant rewrites.  Things are still small enough (and we hope to keep
it that way) that global rewrites are still tractable.

I think the next step would be to have a meeting with you folks in which
(in fact probably before which) we scrutinize the Lively Kernel code and
sketch a few rewrites that would put us on the high road as soon as possible.

While some aspects of 0.8 may bother you, it captures the functionality
we're after pretty well, so we can probably carry out some of these
experiments without too much interference with other ongoing changes.

While I'd like to get together off line, I think this is a project of great
potential importance, so we should try to document as much as possible
as we go, and include our respective mail list communities in the process.

I think that it would be enormously instructive and validating
to show that a relatively complete and self-supporting system can
be rewritten as a secure architecture without making things more
complex and, hopefully even improving its clarity.

Hi,

I think that there may be some confusion as to the intent of LK...  
perhaps mine. Despite Dan's hallowed past, LK does not intend to  
create a new runtime/VM. LK's stated intent is to program the browser  
using the browser's environment sans plug-ins (if possible). "Zero" as  
in zero install. So that's the browser's JavaScript with a few 3rd  
party libraries such as Prototype.

Please correct me if I'm wrong but the most successful implementation  
of Caja is on Google's servers to provide a sandboxed runtime for  
widget/gadget execution. The Apache implementation seems to follow  
this server-side pre-processing approach.

Comparisons to the Squeak's runtime are not relevant since LK does not  
propose to create a runtime.

LK has every chance to fundamentally change browser programming. With  
Sun almost betting Java's future on JavaFX, I think that LK just might  
be the technology to establish Sun as the preeminent browser  
programming vendor and finally compete with Flash on the desktop. And  
once the Opera desktop engine is fully ported to its mobile browser  
next year that will mean that LK becomes the de-facto standard for all  
browser programming.

So unlike in the Smalltalk and Java worlds where you build almost  
everything from scratch, LK has to rely on other technologies for its  
success since@it's core LK is just a JavaScript library with an SVG  
UI toolkit (and some cool networking stuff in the future).


I'd appreciate any corrections to my understanding of LK and Caja  
since as a mash-up vendor we are exploring Caja's potential and are  
already developing for LK.


thanks for making this an open forum.

Hi Zaid,

I believe we have the same understanding, but there may be a minor
terminology issue. Certainly, LK seeks zero install, and using the
browser environment as is sans plugins, just as you say. Caja also
seeks these attributes.

However, it may be more slippery than it appears whether either LK,
Caja, or indeed any comprehensive JS library constitutes a new
runtime/VM. All create a new programmable level of abstraction on top
that provided by the browser. To the extent that this new level of
abstraction seems self contained, so that one can use it without a
detailed understanding of how it is mapped onto the browser's
platform, it does, in effect, a new platform/runtime/VM. But whether
or not LK or Caja should be described in this way, both LK and Caja
would benefit if LK were written in the Caja-compliant subset of
JavaScript.

You are completely correct today, and you are mostly correct for the
foreseeable future: The full Caja translator is written in Java, not
JavaScript, and is too large to consider downloading to the browser.
As a result, Caja itself cannot support the LK style of self-contained
live programming environment within the browser *for Caja code*.

To address these very kinds of concerns, we have defined a small
subset of Caja called Cajita. Cajita is no less useful, expressive,
convenient, or secure a programming language than Caja. However, it
leaves out so much of JavaScript that one would only recommend it for
new code. Caja is a much larger subset of JavaScript in order to be
friendlier to old JavaScript code. Cajita is sufficiently small that
we expect to port the Cajita->JavaScript portion of the translator
into Cajita, in which case we can support live programming (and eval)
of Cajita code safely, purely within the browser.

Of these other technologies, how much of their code could be within
the scope of LK's browser system, and subject to live reprogramming?
Within the constraints of the existing browser platform, I think the
answer must be essentially none. The code that appears in LK's
browsers will almost all be new code anyway. Were the code in LK's
browsers in Cajita, and were we to realize our fantasy of a
browser-side Cajita translator, then the LK browsers could eval it
live, as LK currently does for JS code. Since Cajita (like Caja) is a
subset of JavaScript, this can be explored today, without waiting for
Cajita to be ready.

[ZAID] I apologize... I disagree with this premise because LK is by  
definition not a sealed environment where apps are "certified" like in  
the mobile world. LK requires Prototype and even if it didn't, a  
developer can use all of JavaScript@anytime to manipulate most of  
LK. Unless LK implemented some type of defensive programming in each  
of its APIs-- and somehow was able to stop direct manipulation of the  
SVG and JavaScript objects--  isn't this just making LK into a  
security R&D prototype with no possible commercial viability?

I honestly believe that a more pressing security and feature issue for  
the LK team is centered around networking and cross-domain support. I  
just announced on Tuesday our Dynamic Mashup Server as part of our  
support for the Comet (HTTP Streaming/Push) implementation done by Sun  
in Grizzly. What I didn't mention in the press release is that I built/ 
tested the functionality against LK clients. What that means is that  
any LK client can be updated/synchronized from a Dynamic Mashup Server  
en-mass. So with the new LK serialization capability we can have  
scalable shared sub-worlds across the internet.


But as you know, the paramount issue in this is the same origin server  
issue and trusting the server. Cross-domain support has been solved on  
the client in Flash, Opera Widgets, and will be addressed in FireFox 3  
(and HTML5).  It's good that Stephen Uhler  is associated with the LK  
team since he did an interesting proxy implementation in Brazil.


So what will LK do? go the Flash or Java Applet route? create a web  
server plug-in? use Apache's solution? implement that proxy back door  
server that was in the LK .7 code? Or just skip shared worlds because  
they introduce a whole range of network security issues far more than  
just browser programming.

If the LK team doesn't get this write, then only trivial network apps  
will be written for LK because confidential or personal information  
(aka social apps) will not be shared because they do not trust the LK  
server. If the LK team implements dynamic, state-full inspection and  
verification during sub-world sharing using Caja-like technology, then  
that's where LK becomes more than just a single user or small-group  
JavaScript and SVG programming environment.


So, I would like you to consider that maybe getting the network  
security model done correctly is more important than ensuring that LK  
itself and personal morphlets are secure. So my vote is to secure on  
sharing sub-worlds to deny XSS and script injection, etc. but not the  
execution within the browser.

[ZAID] I think we agree if by "support live programming (and eval)"  
only refers to remote sub-worlds/morphlets and whatever is the unit of  
transmission/sharing.

[ZAID] sure, but to what aim? A limited availability security  
prototype? LK can accomplish far more and can solve the security issue  
on sharing sub-worlds/morphlets because when LK goes P2P (peer-to- 
peer) via an LK server you're really introducing unknown live code.  
The normal LK code is coming from a server to which you contacted  
since that's the normal web browser-to-server client-server stuff.

P2P LK is the only new aspect that needs to be secured IMO. But the LK  
team will decide according to its SunLabs mandate.


I would also like you to consider implementing Caja in Single-Site  
Browsers (SSB) such as Mozilla Prism and Todd Ditchendorf's WebKit  
implementation of the SSB concept. First, they make wickedly fast LK  
clients. We call them the ultimate mash-up client because they are  
built to support browsing a single site or mash-up and can't interact  
with other sites. So in this context, Caja moves the browser into a  
really secure platform. . Fast and secure.

[ZAID] thanks again for the opportunity to correspond with you and I  
think that my opposition is to when and where we enforce security:  
constantly in the browser or on the server only when sharing among  
strangers.

Folks -

We've just pushed a minor update out to the main site...

	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/index.xhtml

It fixes a couple of bugs and now runs (or@least limps along) on 
Firefox, Opera and Batik-Squiggle (ask us), as well as the 
still-preferred Safari.

It also has a FrameRateMorph  (3 short methods) in the world's 'new 
object...' menu that will report the number of updates/second and max 
latency, the Engine has a "fast" setting (you'll see why this is in 
quotes ;-) to test performance, and there's a new SquiggleMorph (also 
3 short methods -- it's just a sketch (get it?)) to let you make very 
basic freehand drawings.

Enjoy

Lively Kernel (LK) is a really exciting project! I think the  
Javascript language is already very interesting and will be even more  
so in the future, so it is a good place to be.

Here are a few thoughts on LK's potential. Have any of these points  
been considered, yet?

- Ecmascript 4: This version feels like a "good-enough" mix of Lisp,  
Dylan, Smalltalk, Self, while it is bound to have the same amount of  
broad tool support that Java currently enjoys. It will also  
inevitably run on the JVM. Two consequences arise for LK: (1) If its  
language extensions mimick ES4, a transition will be easier later.  
(2) Soon LK will have the option of being a desktop environment (when  
hosted on the JVM).

- Client/server programming: My guess is that LK could be the ideal  
distributed environment. You would implement your application in LK  
and then decide which parts stay on the server (JVM-hosted?) and  
which parts stay on the client.

- Look and feel: What still puts me slightly off Morphic is that it  
is non-standard. This does not mean that I particularly like how the  
Mac OS or Windows do their thing, but it is still standardized enough  
that you can easily switch between them (or even between them and  
Gnome or KDE for that matter). I think it would be both a practical  
and a marketing advantage to emulate these operating systems as much  
as is reasonable.

Thanks for your time,

Axel Rauschmayer

I suspect you are thinking of Flex / ActionScript 3.0.  I think one of  
the problems is that AS 3 is lacking some of the uber-dynamic features  
available in JavaScript, like eval().  I'm guessing that, in LK, when  
you "edit a method", the method body is eval'd (or passed into  
Function(), which I believe is also unavailable), and then attached to  
the relevant object (class?).  You might imagine rigging something up  
where you send 'classes' to reload to a server, which compiles them to  
ABC (AS 3.0 bytecode format), and then hope that there's some way of  
dynamically loading the .abc file in a running Flash movie.   
Alternatively, write a compiler in AS 3.0 that compiles 'source' to an  
ABC format, and then use a dynamic loading capability to 'load' the  
class.

Both seem pretty painful.

Another option might be to use Flash as the UI, but use 'browser JS'  
in the browser as your 'code'.  Since I believe you can bi- 
directionally talk between a Flash movie and browser JS.  Still seems  
kinda painful.

But here's the killer for me.  Flex currently doesn't support the  
mouse wheel on the Mac to scroll through scrollable things.  Making it  
totally useless as a UI framework for me.  Anymore, the only use I  
have for scroll bars, almost anywhere, is the visual feedback; the  
inane precise mousing required to drive it is frankly nuts.

Lots of assumptions here; please correct me if I'm wrong!

Hi Patrick
Thanks for your thoughts. You are quite right about the dynamic compilation
problem. My thinking was thrown off track by the work on Vista Smalltalk (
http://vistasmalltalk.wordpress.com/). What I had forgotten was that rather
than using the Flash VM to execute Javascript,  Peter had first written a
lisp interpreter in Actionscript and then used that to interpret and run
Smalltalk.  Sadly, that project now seems to be dead, but it did show great
potential.

Re the scroll wheel problem. I have a funny feeling that that problem is
actually solvable. I think there is a way of coding up scroll wheel support
in Flex.

We have been following the development of JavaScript 2
(a.k.a. Ecmascript 4) with quite a bit of interest.

There is a good summary of Ecmascript 4 features
available@the Mozilla web site:

http://www.ecmascript.org/es4/spec/overview.pdf

See also:

http://www.ecmascript.org/es4/spec/evolutionary-programming-tutorial.pdf

Personally, I still have mixed feelings about Ecmascript 4.
While JavaScript 1.* was a relatively simple language,
JavaScript 2 seems like a "kitchen sink" designed by a
committee -- so many features have been added that the
language feels rather different from those versions of
JavaScript that are widely used today (1.5 - 1.7).

It remains to be seen how quickly the industry will
actually adopt the new specification (the spec work
has taken several years already).  That said, JS2
will surely have a big impact in the industry as soon
as decent implementations become available in widely
used web browsers.  As soon as that happens, we will
start using JS2, too.

====

About running the Lively Kernel on a JVM: we did have
an earlier version of the system running as an applet
on top of a JVM, Rhino, and the Java 2D graphics API
instead of SVG.  For various reasons, the Java version
wasn't made available as part of the open source release,
but we might still release it later.

Yes.  In fact, we currently have a grad student
in the project looking@this problem.

It is certainly true that the look-and-feel of the
Lively Kernel is different from mainstream UIs today.
We've also noticed that@the API level, the Morphic
APIs require some adjustment from the developers when
they first start writing applications for the system.

As you may have noticed, the look-and-feel of the
Lively Kernel is intended to be customizable, so
that the developers can change the UI themes and
styles of individual UI elements@will.  However,
these features have not been documented well, so
the features probably aren't very obvious or easy
to use yet.

Perhaps Dan can comment more on these features
(and on this topic more generally) when he
comes back from vacation.

A quick reply:

We've certainly talked about porting the Lively
Kernel to run on Flash.  There are three main
reasons why we haven't done that:

(1) Our general preference in the project has been
to avoid plug-in components as much as possible.
In fact, one of our main research goals was to
build a web application environment that would
run in a regular web browser without any plug-in
components whatsoever.

(2) Our resources are limited and we had to choose
which platforms to support.  It should be relatively
easy to retarget the Lively Kernel to run on Flash,
but we haven't had the time to do that yet.

(3) (In response to your heretical question...) As you
can imagine, using a Flash plug-in wouldn't make our
project very easy to market inside Sun.

I agree, the relatively radical departure from JS 1.x is a bit weird.  
On the other hand, they are using Python as a role model from which  
they borrowed most of their features (I like Python...). I've been  
waiting for years for a decent language such as Lisp or Smalltalk to  
make it into the true mainstream. JS2 is not as good, but seems  
bearable. Furthermore, compared to Python, we get optional static  
typing, compared to Smalltalk we get some interesting modularity  
constructs.

I wonder whether modularity constructs will change the style of LK  
programming, as they partially run counter to direct manipulation  
(you have to encapsulate changes to the system in a module instead of  
applying them directly).

Maybe you guys should work together with the JS group, because you  
are giving Javascript something that it does not have yet: a proper  
development environment.

Sun's Phobos comes to mind, as well as Aptana's Jaxer [1]. I see two  
possible models:

(1) Fat server, thin client: The server manages the data, the client  
is mainly a user interface layer that keeps a little data locally,  
but mainly sends the changes directly to the server. Advantage:  
Relatively close to traditional web architectures, small browser  
memory footprint. Disadvantage: Webapp cannot be used offline.

(2) Thin server, fat client: Then the server is more like a version  
control system and used to synchronize between complete copies of the  
data that are kept in the browser. Advantage: Editing is faster (no  
need to communicate with the server) and works offline. Disadvantage:  
Takes up a lot of memory/processing time in the browser.

If you will, keep us posted on the progress.

OK. I still think that Swing found a very good compromise between  
doing everything itself and completely relying on the host operating  
system. I'm not sure how this translates to a browser environment,  
but it always made Swing applications usable by "normal" people. On  
the other hand, even though I wanted to like Squeak (which is an  
amazing achievement), I could not get myself to use it, mainly due to  
its UI (even just for myself I was hesitant, for non-technical people  
it's just too quirky).

Folks -

I've now spent several hours working on LK without the use of any 
other software (pretty much).  We hope to put out a release by the 
end of this week that will allow you to do the same.

Here's how it works:

On a server somewhere you place personal copies of the LK source 
files.  I actually use Apache on my Mac with the files on my Mac so I 
can work away from the Internet.  Doing it this way, I'm only using 
what anyone could use on a computer with a browser and no disk and no 
other software.

You start up Safari and load up the Lively Kernel (I typically do 
development with Config.skipMostExamples = true to make things load 
quicker).  Then you go into the development world and in the 
directory browser you select the source code files you care about and 
use the menu command to open a changeList on each.  This provides a 
window for browsing all the class and method definitions in the file 
without running up against the limits of LK's current text editor.

Then you make the changes you want and and open a second tab or 
window of Safari to try out the new version.  If it crashes, you can 
just go back to the first tab that is still running a stable version 
and fix what you need to, until things are right.

This cycle can be repeated many times, interrupted only by times that 
you manage to take out Safari (rare) or the whole OS (I haven't done 
this yet).  When that happens, you will have to get back to some 
stable source code and restart the process.  This can require another 
text editor :-(.

When you've done what you set out to do, then you use CVS (or your 
favorite groupware) to commit your changes to the team shared code 
database, and go on to start on the next project.  It's actually the 
rudiments of team development, all in LK.  Woo-hoo!

By the way, text is much faster, the browser can now view the actual 
source code (ie with comments, and not decompiled), and I'm working 
on searches for all senders and implementers of selected messages.

Stay tuned

	- Dan (for the team)


PS:  In case this all seems overly nerdy, the gestalt I am working 
toward is that each time you make a change, it becomes a new web page 
that you or anyone else can share and experiment with .  In that way 
the unit of distribution is the same, whether you're building an 
application, fixing a bug in the text editor, or making a Christmas 
card.  It's just that there are a few more things to finish between 
here and there...

I eagerly await the new release.

I love the direction you are headed toward, with one exception.

Despite the wonderful advances in data storage technology, making a  
complete copy of ten or twenty thousand lines of code for each  
project seems excessive to me. I know I can avoid that by just  
continuing to use git for the storage, but that seems excessively  
retro to me.

What would please me is a system with the base and mods distinguished  
so that twenty little projects can consume only slightly more space  
than the unmodified system. You could say the base system was  
"transcluded by reference" in the new system or the Christmas card.

Transclusion clearly won't be necessary for the first Lively Kernel  
version without a separate git or CVS source code control system, but  
I hope it will be designed with that in mind and in the explicit plans.

Incidentally, there is now a roughly one page summary of "The Humane  
Interface"@http://bilconference.pbwiki.com/The+Humane+Interface  
for anyone who cares about making their system work well with humans.

Subject: [General] [ANN] HTML Layout and Rendering Engine for Morphic is now
	shipping
Message-ID: <7DD5286C-A264-4F7A-84D3-8378642E7674@altmobile.com>

Hi,

A new release of our Web 2.0 developer tools are now shipping.  
Included is the "HTML Layout and Rendering Engine and a Form Editor  
for Morphic" that I announced here:

http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/pipermail/general/20080127/000004.html


To ease development of LK apps, I've bundled a copy of LK. We include  
an embedded web server, so it's a complete web development environment  
for building Web mash-ups with LK clients :-)

Since LK is in flux, we haven't ported all of our mash-up tools to LK  
and consequently there is no formal product documentation. I'll blog  
with samples over the weekend.




And here's the blog announcement:

http://web.mac.com/altmobile/altmobile_blog/ALT_Mobile_Blog/Entries/2008/3/21_Announcing_XML_Studio_v7.3.html


I am pleased to announce that version 7.3 of the <alt> XML Studio is  
now shipping. Featuring the industry's first commercial Comet  
developer tools, the XML Studio breaks new ground in the development  
and testing of Web 2.0 applications.

Developers can now build and test real-time streaming mash-up  
applications. Version 7.3 embeds a copy of the upcoming <alt> Dynamic  
Mashup Server  which uses a custom version of Grizzly, the Comet  
technology from Sun.

In addition to its Web 2.0 server support, version 7.3 of the XML  
Studio adds mash-up developer support for 3 new Web 2.0 client  
technologies: Mozilla Prism (the single-site browser (SSB) technology  
from Mozilla Labs, Sun's Likely Kernel (a JavaScript/SVG web  
programming environment from Sun Labs), and Microsoft's WebSlices (a  
new feature of Internet Explorer 8).

Previous versions of the XML Studio introduced mash-up developer tools  
for Opera Widgets, Apple Dashboard Widgets, Adobe AIR, Microsoft Vista  
Sidebar Gadgets, RSS mash-up feeds, Yahoo! Pipes, Google Gadgets,  
JavaFX Script, and Safari on iPhone.

Version 7.3 of the XML Studio also adds new capabilities to its Web  
3.0 semantic web developer tools. Now, our RDF mash-up meta data  
includes support for SSML-- the W3C standard for speech synthesis. By  
explicitly including text-to-speech technology in our mash-up RDF  
definitions, we hope that both the visually impaired and non-English  
speaking users will become full participants in the mash-up revolution.

The <alt> XML Studio is available for Mac OS X, Windows XP, Windows  
Vista, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE, Ubuntu, and Solaris.

To download a copy of the <alt> XML Studio, visit http://altmobile.com/Home.html

Changing e.g. fishEye to true, changes the object behaviour. However,
setting the rgb() value to something new has no effect. How come?

Hello, Andy -

There is no general dependence mechanism in JavaScript so that changes to values get magically acted on.  It happens that the fisheye mechanism tests the fishEye property in such a way that only setting the flag is necessary.

However if you want a morph's color to change, you should use the setFill() method.  This will take care of the necessary and appropriate propagation of change so that the SVG graphic routines get appropriately informed.

In general we favor a procedural interface for such changes.  We have toggleFisheye(), but should probably also have setFisheye(trueOrFalse).

Hope this helps

	- Dan

I tried entering setFill(255,0,0) as the new value for fill in the inspector (top right pane) and both accepting the change and executing javascript.

No problem.  In the absence of adequate documentation (to which we readily confess) your best bet is to search the code base.  There you will discover, either through usage or comments in the code, that setFill expects its argument to be a Color or a Gradient (Linear or Radial).

I believe the correct way to write your example is

	this.setFill(new Color(1, 0, 0));  // We use 0..1 instead of 0..255.

Hope this helps.  I've CC'd the list in case this kind of info may be useful to others.

Hi,

I've posted a couple of blog entries on Lively Kernel. WIth Friday's  
big release of our Web 2.0 developer tools, we now provide tools for  
creating Mashups for the following Web 2.0 client technologies:

Sun's Lively Kernel
Sun's JavaFX Script
Adobe AIR
Apple Dashboard Widgets
Apple's Safari on iPhone
Google Gadgets
Microsoft IE 8's WebSlices
Mozilla Prism

As part of a series on the strengths and weakness of Web 2.0 clients,  
I also discuss how to create a Mashup client for each of the  
technologies.

One goal is to provide insight to developers-- so that they better  
understand what's needed for their upcoming Web 2.0 projects-- and the  
other goal is for company strategist from Adobe, Apple, Google,  
Microsoft, Mozilla, Opera, Sun, Yahoo!, etc to see where their  
products _really_ fit in the Web 2.0 world.

I think that this is a better service to technologists and developers  
than the puff pieces and hatchet jobs from the less-than-qualified  
writers and bloggers.


* The series starts off with this blog post (Web 2.0 Technologies:  
Clients):

http://web.mac.com/altmobile/altmobile_blog/ALT_Mobile_Blog/Entries/2008/3/22_An_Introduction_to_Web_2.0_Clients.html


* and the specific ones on LK are here (Web 2.0 Clients: Sun's Lively  
Kernel):

Hi, Andy -

We use
	console.log(<string expression>)
The results show up on the error log of whatever browser you are using.

We are about to release a new version of LK which includes its own console window.  When you open one, then this content goes to your LK window and not to the error console.  More about various other related new features in the next day or two...

Greetings, Herbert, and all -

Thanks for this query.  It got us thinking about all the things we 
have to do, and the various places we could use some help.  Step one 
is probably just to share all that with the folks who have signed up, 
and we can see where it goes from there.

It probably makes the most sense to start with some goals -- 
artifacts we'd like to build, or demos we'd like to give -- which 
means cool capabilities we'd like to put in the hands of LK users. 
Then, from that context, and some first principles, we can give you a 
laundry list of things we need to do.  In each case, we are hoping 
you will all have various comments and suggestions.  It's our hope 
that as we start to be more articulate on this end, some of you who 
have been lurking out there will be moved to step forward and 
contribute as well.

	- Dan, as scribe
---------------------------

UI Completeness and Polish
For LK to become a realistic application platform, it must be able to 
create a look and feel that is second to none.  To this end there are 
several areas in need of improvement.  The best impetus for this work 
is to produce several real web sites.  The biggest challenge will be 
to keep things small and simple while enabling increasingly 
sophisticated appearance.  Here are some obvious targets for 
improvement:
	More widgets
	Better importing of finished graphics
	Full support for curves and text on curves
	More CSS-style control

End-user scripting
The Morphic architecture of LK, together with live JavaScript, 
provides a natural context for end-user scripting with a tile-like 
interface similar to that in Scratch and Squeak EToys.  To begin work 
along these lines, we need:
	A parse tree framework for JavaScript
	A basic shape vocabulary for each parse node type
	A concept for browsing and inspecting@this level

Media
Dear to our hearts is the symbiotic relationship of computation and 
media.  A real strength of LK is its ability to support active 
objects in a much more general way than most other web platforms. 
However there is still a gap in our capability in the area of current 
expectations with regard to sound and video.
	Sound - We have a piano keyboard; help us make it play
	Video

Engine room
There are still several places where the Lively Kernel requires work 
on performance and robustness.  None is holding us back@this 
point, but all will probably become important as LK sees more actual 
use.
	Text Speed (already improved)
	Rich Text (mostly
	HTML support

JavaScript IDE
If it were never even used as an application platform, the Lively 
Kernel could easily be the IDE of choice for dynamic web media.  We 
now have a powerful set of reflective facilities in place, and 
concentration on just a few areas could yield dramatic results.  Here 
are some we have in mind:
	Parsing for better diagnostics
	Syntax coloring
	Spelling correction
	Integrated documentation
	More EMACS-style integration of editor and evaluator
	Intra-method parsing and emulation for full debugging support

Cleanup
This is a tough one for a distributed community, but a kernel like LK 
is in constant need of decomposition and refactoring in order to keep 
it from getting bloated and unmaintainable.

Layout support
We now have an experimental framework for automatic layout 
constraints.  A fair amount of work remains to be done integrating 
this with existing widgets and windows.

Web Site development
It should be possible to build an entire active web site while giving 
a demo in the Lively Kernel.  We need to concentrate on a few 
realistic scenarios and make this a reality.

Hosting
Coupled with web site development is the issue of hosting.  We need 
to establish a hosting environment in which people can create 
interesting sites, and gain exposure for creative accomplishments.

Server leverage
So far the Lively Kernel has been mostly a client-side artifact. 
there is no reason to limit ourselves in this way.  Here are some 
projects that would highlight the possible server-side synergy.
	GUI Builder - 20 minutes in LK to produce a client-side interface
		remote data and services
	Database access - deeper LK services with shared access and 
more horsepower
	Collaboration - we had this working a year ago.  Time to 
revive shared white boards
		and webcasting with LK

Community
It will soon make sense to have a wiki in addition to our mailing 
list.  This should, of course, be a lively wiki.  In fact our whole 
web site should be a lively site, so there's some overlap here with 
the web site topic above.  Also we need to get our documentation to 
be lively so that it tracks the current rapid rate of change and 
refactoring.

Hi, Reed -

We haven't observed this problem, but we believe you.  We're planning 
to redo the whole tutorial as much more of a web site all in the 
Lively Kernel very soon.  Until that time, though...

Can you run the regular (non-tutorial) version of LK at...

	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/index.xhtml

or the recent beta...

	http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/0.8.5/index.xhtml

It will be useful for us to know in either case.  If either of these 
works for you, you could read the tutorial as static material, and 
try the examples in the live system in another window.

Thanks, Reed.   It's always fun to talk about this work.  I'm glad 
you enjoyed it.

Indeed!

We've been playing with it a bit, and I can report the following results...

I see a clean 2x improvement over Safari 3.1 (and I recall this was nearly 2x over the earlier WebKit...

	Safari 3.1		1.7M sends/sec	 71M ops/sec
	Firefox 3.1	3.2M sends/sec	 130M ops/sec
	webkit 5/21	3.9M sends/sec	154M ops/sec

... as measured by http://weather-dimensions.com/Dan/JavaScriptBenchmark.html

They have a way to go to equal a good interpreter (Squeak does 11M sends, 525M ops on the same machine), but this is finally becoming a serious programming medium!  Isn't it nice to have all the browser makers working for us!

In fact most Lively apps run about the same speed because our current bottleneck is the DOM interface to SVG graphics and SVG itself.  One notable exception is text composition, where we do all the "heavy lifting" in JavaScript and, yes indeed, it's now twice as fast.

Hi, Jiri -

I sure hope so.

Now is the time for the SVG folks to start doing some of the same 
sort of engineering that is being done on JavaScript.  The Lively 
Kernel could run *much* faster with just a bit of work.  If no one 
does this, eventually we will, but for now we'll keep holding a 
carrot out there to see what others can do.

Our current priorities are

>  Exploit the delightful uniformity of doing everything ourselves in JavaScript

>  Explore high-security variants (Caja etc)

>  Experiment with end-user programming and easy wiki-like web content creation

>  Explore possibilities of multi-user web pages (ie, collaboration)

>  Build the ultimate power-user web programming tool

None of this is about performance... yet.

At any point we (or some of you out there in Lurky-Land) could work 
on a faster Canvas model (but beware text), do a lively plugin (we 
did this once already), or even link to native widgets.  Right now, 
though, our current strategy leaves the entire system much more 
malleable, and therefore a better vehicle for these explorations.

Is this the right forum to ask little fiddly questions about LK?

I'm trying to use LK to build a little application that's basically a
bunch of boxes connected by lines. I want the two endpoints of each
line to stay attached to whichever box they're attached to (even if
those boxes move around). Right now I'm accomplishing this by checking
all the lines every N milliseconds to see whether the box@each end
has moved (and if it has then I update the vertices of the line
accordingly). That works OK, but it seems like an ugly solution, and
it's turning out to be a strain on the computer.

I was hoping that there'd be some method somewhere that gets called
every time a particular morph moves (whether that morph was itself
moved, or whether its owner or its owner's owner moved or whatever).
I've been looking through the source code and so far I haven't found a
method that looks like that (but it's very possible that I've missed
it). Methods like setBounds and translateBy seem almost like what I
need, except that (if I understand correctly) they only get called if
the morph itself is moved, not if its owner is moved. I could probably
hack something together that would sorta work, but I was hoping for
some advice from someone who's more familiar with LK.

Hugh -

It's our intention to provide .zip files with each release.  However we are still setting up the new framework which you discovered, and have not yet put out a zip file.  For now, just "grab the contents" as you are doing.

We have a fair amount of news and new features to announce.  I'll try to get a message out in the next day or two.

Believe it or not, ticking scripts are the first thing to try, simply because it's so easy.

This is an interesting case (I encountered the same thing in my engine example) because the lines don't match the tree model of graphics very well.  One of the nice things about transformations on every node is that you don't have to broadcast translation changes downward -- usually, but not in this case.

We're actually working on that code right now -- mainly to get a decent layout model in place.  We have a downward propagation for changes in extent, and you example indicates a need for a matching protocol for transformations as well.

You might want to stick to your ticking approach a while longer, in which case you can probably improve performance/response by adding a strategy to the ticking rate:  use faster ticking for lines that moved in the last interval, and slower ticking for those that didn't.

Let us know what you're up to some time -- another purpose of this list.

I want to try using LK to make something like a topic-map browser.
I've got something slow and ugly and buggy running right now at
http://conceptulate.com (but you'll need an OpenID to try it out,
because I haven't gotten around to making a "guest" mode yet).

Hi, Adam -

The very latest beta of FF runs LK decently, as does the 3.0 release as well.

We are working to make LK able to run in IE using the Examotion SVG plugin.

It would be great if you wanted to play around a bit with this.  We  have it already putting bits on the screen.  I hereby introduce you to Krzysztof (whom you probably remember), and who has inherited some changes that Tommi Mikkonen made to get things this far (Tommi's on vacation for a month).

Krzysztof, perhaps you could eyeball Tommi's changes, and either forward them to Adam with a bit of explanation, or put them out to this list, in case others might want to join in the fun.

Or put them in the new repository, hehe, and tell everyone about that.

Unfortunately, LK only half runs in FF 3.0.  And, I mean that quite
literally. Only the top half of the screen gets drawn.  Everything appears
to be working correctly, I can see the top of the piston moving up and down,
but nothing beyond about 150 px below that.  I am running on OSX 10.5.3.

Hi,
	We've seen this problem in Opera but not in Firefox so far. I believe  
this might be a timing issue, we may be asking for the size of the  
screen available to LK before the browser has fully computed it. This  
would explain why the same Firefox behaves differently on different  
machines.

If you look in index.xhtml, the top level SVG element declared in it  
has the attribute height="%100". If you hardcode a concrete value of  
height, say, 800pt, it'll likely work as expected. We have some  
workaround code in main() that tries to detect when height is less  
than 100, but apparently fails in your case (perhaps because somehow  
FF decided that 100% height means 150pt, which happens to be less than  
100).

Frankly I don't know if this is the problem with SVG implementation in  
Firefox or my lack of understanding of timing aspects of the spec, so  
I'm not sure what the right solution would be. I could try to change  
the threshold value in main() from 100 to 200, although I can't  
reproduce the problem so I wouldn't know if the fix works. It won't be  
any uglier than the workaround we already have in place :)

These applications do not require a network
connection when they are running.

However, without a network connection, you will not be able
to launch these applications (or any other Lively Kernel
applications) unless the application source code is located
on your local machine.

 From your web browser, you can launch "offline" applications
using "file:" instead of "http:".

A friend pointed me@http://zoomii.com which he says is 14,000 lines 
of JavaScript. Is it a Lively Kernel application? It uses and connects 
with Amazon while presenting books as if they were in a physical store, 
but offers handy access to much more information than a brick and mortar 
store can provide.

I still want to try out the JustGo idea shown on my website. It is 
supposed to make a zoom world even easier to explore by not needing any 
clicks to wander about and see stuff. Lively Kernel seems like a great 
way to explore this notion but I get stuck right away and can't even 
tell how to put text into text boxes or edit such text.

Is any manual for LK anticipated in the next few months?

Dick, i'm pretty sure zoomii is built using the flare framework 
(http://flare.prefuse.org/) which is a Flex/Flash (ActionScript) version 
of the Prefuse lib. Looks very much like some demos i've seen.

Prefuse is a Java lib i think that is built on top of AT&T/Bell Lab's 
Graphviz work (http://www.graphviz.org/) which is primarily a discrete 
math lib that exposes graph theory very nicely.

I'm guessing this is a very low priority for you guys. :) I wouldn't

Hi Adam,
	On the contrary, we'd love to have system copy&paste working, and I  
spent some time on it but I got frustrated as well.... Looks like  
there are browser APIs for both C&P and D&D, and they seem to work in  
HTML. Unfortunately that's the end of good news. XHTML support seems  
to be spotty, and, AFAIK, SVG support is nonexistent (the oncopy/ 
onpaste  events never fire on SVG elements).
Presumably it could be possible to register handlers on the XHTML  
element enclosing the SVG canvas (presumably in the capture phase) and  
use Lively Kernel's logic to figure out which Morph should handle it.  
I don't remember now if I tried it and it didn't work or I've never  
tried... If you'd like to give it a try, it'd be awesome ...
	
	The backspace problem has also been reported, I left it out since I  
don't develop on Windows, but we should fix it... If find a solution,  
please let us know...

	Krzysztof

The backspace issue highlights the sheer heroism of those making Lively 
run on browsers :-)

As a matter of pragmatism   -is anyone working on the Rhino+ Batik 
implementation? I note rhino-compat.js in the source download.

I'm negotiating a research project where it would be great to use LK, 
but I don't want to be researching heroic backspace workarounds on windows.

On the other hand, a JRE requirement  would be workable (especially 
given the demonstrable path towards "nothin-but-browser" ) . 

Perhaps I'm being naive about the difficulty of the Java approach, but 
it strikes me as being a great complement to pure browser Lively   
-having different deployment, hackability and performance tradeoffs. 
I'm not personally up for a complete Java LK implementation, but if 
there was half an implementation sitting somewhere, I'd be keen to have 
a look.

I would also be fascinated to hear any comments on the relative merits 
of the Java approach vs Examotion(etc)  -as an IE solution   (and come 
to that, on the viability of Lively on VML)

I really meant to do some more research before asking these questions,

Hi Peter,
	We were, and still are quite interested in a pure Java version of  
Lively.
Actually, I got a big chunk of LK to work under Rhino+Batik@some  
point and it even ran semi-decently on a fast machine. The major  
missing bits were support for XmlHttpRequest and font metrics. As a  
stopgap measure, I simply made up the font metrics, so text looked  
ridiculous, but it did show on the screen. As for XHR, we've been told  
that there is@least one implementation out in the wild that could  
be potentially integrated with the codebase.

I was planning to try to access font metrics from Javascript using  
Rhino's Java interface, but never got to do it, if you or anyone else  
were interested in taking a look, that would be awesome! :) And I'll  
be glad to pass on whatever little I know about the problems.
It all used to run from the main source tree (Lively.svg is the entry  
point). If it doesn't any more, it's probably a matter of few small  
fixes.

Of course, the Holy Grail of LK on Rhino+Batik would be to package it  
as a Java applet that could broaden the reach of LK to those condemned  
to IE.  However, although both myself and my employer are emotionally  
attached to the Java platform, the perception is that Java is not  
really a part of the so called Open Web. From the Open Web  
perspective, the Examotion plugin seems more palatable than Rhino 
+Batik, since it appears to be a workaround for missing native support  
for a standard graphics format, as opposed to an independent platform  
and execution engine (actually two, JVM and then Rhino on top of it,  
in addition to the browser's JS engine). It's probably also a smaller  
download... On the other hand, it'd be nice to have access to all the  
goodies that come with the Java platform....

As for VML, from what I've heard it was always noticeably slower than  
browser SVG implementations (not speed demons, either), and I don't  
think Microsoft cares about it much anymore, since they hope that  
everyone will use Silverlight instead (much like Adobe, who stopped  
bothering with their SVG plugin once they bought Macromedia and bet  
the house on Flash/Flex). Now, from what I understand, Silverlight  
supports (through XAML) a graphics model quite similar to SVG, and it  
can run some version of Javascript, and it runs on the Mac.
	
Lively/Silverlight, anyone :)?

thanks Krzysztof   -sounds like you were running Lively on Squiggle

the same thing in Java     -yes?

where "main source tree" ==

Squiggle in fact complains...

InterpExcept: org.apache.batik.script.InterpreterException: error 
instantiating
(0): class org.w3c.dom.xpath.XPathEvaluator is interface or abstract 
(Core.js#76
0)

I haven't looked into it, but its the sort of error I would anticipate 
making Lively run on another "browser" :-)

inasmuch as living with the applet sandbox can be considered grail-ish  
-yes   -and that is what i had in mind by Rhino+Batik (as opposed to 
Squiggle, which i didn't know about)

True  -but ironic how a closed source plugin for a closed source borwser 
is more "open web" than a 100% open source approach.

The IE plugin that I went looking for was in fact Firefox. There was a 
project to maintain a Firefox ActiveX control, but it looks dormant. It 
sounds as though such things will be easier on FF3 and perhaps the 
XULRunner project might yield something. I have nothing against the 
Examotion approach, and it seems the right thing to do (short of vml)    
-but the  browser inside a browser would be easy for you!  (and making 
LK in some sense a platform within a platform within a platform)

yes  -doing a VML LK would be a thankless task, but if it *could* be 
done, then there would be a native LK for IE  (although i suspect that 
vml isn't necessarily enabled or even enableable for many users). The 
work on the Examotion approach will of course make vml easier as you 
will have to deal with the JScript side


 >>and I don't think Microsoft cares about it much anymore<<

funny how people look@the glacial pace of IE development, and say 
"how can mozilla do more with less"  -they don't appreciate how hard MS 
is back-peddaling on html!

as it happens i deleted a line from my post re java saying something 
like "would morhic over wpf/silverlight under dlr javascript be lively?  
-would it be Lively?"

i suspect you would lose live scripting under that model (whereas rhino 
is a pure interpreter right?  -so it doesn't hit the security 
restrictions that both java and .net impose around emitting bytecodes in 
the sandbox????)

but i agree, Silverlight sure looks **new and shiny** and a good LK 
target to me..


..on the other hand, if you think about Lively in the Silverlight, or 
Java (maybe even Flash)  worlds, perhaps you *don't* want the 
superstructure of a vml or xaml or flex

thought experiment:

at what point do you lose the spirit of the Lively Kernel?

a) A custom Lively applet which amounts to Squiggle (viz. Rhino+Batik)

b) As above, but with some mods to Batik to better support Lively (eg 
the color interface)

c)Further mods to Batik to implement the stripped down VML core required 
by LK  -ie the core that  Dan Ingalls mentioned on the FLOSS Weekly 
podcast (or was it somewhere else?)

d)Morhic implementation in Java or C#  -with a thinner, livelier Lively 
on top. 


hey, maybe you could implement morphic against awt in a constrained 
javascript style, that was translatable to java  -now where have i seen 
that sort of idea implemented??

Message-ID: <p0624080bc54d3c95d0f3@[10.0.232.219]>
Status: O

Folks -

There are some very creative people in this community, and yet 
everyone seems to be just lurking.  So I thought I would present a 
little fireside chat to get things going.


The Lively Kernel
We've found the name "Lively Kernel" to be confusing to a number of 
people (nearly equal to the number who hear it ;-).  See, "kernel" to 
me means any seminal bundle of functionality adequate for 
implementing cool stuff.  It's like, well, a kernel of corn, from 
which you can make a whole corn stalk (and more corn to boot).  But 
there are a lot of people out there -- you know, the ones who like C 
syntax -- who say "I don't get it;  this isn't like the Unix kernel, 
is it?"

So we've taken to just calling it "Lively" recently.  For one thing, 
it's shorter;  half the syllables.  For another, it emphasizes the 
part that keeps us interested -- it is, by gosh, a lively piece of 
software, and that is our passion:  to deliver some of the wonderful 
flexibility of our silicon engines through to end users, especially 
kids, in a manner that inspires them to explore and invent our future.

Lively
There's more about the name "Lively" too, and here I have to credit 
Krzysztof with a number of the observations.  In the process of 
implementing LK on top of SVG, and Java2D, and the JavaFX scene 
graph, we've learned something.  Just as JavaScript has some 
shortcomings from being raised as a scripting language (and we can 
get into that sometime), these graphics systems have a number of 
shortcomings because they were raised as rendering systems.  "Duh, 
what else?" you ask.

I'll tell you:  Active computing environments.  There's something 
horribly absent in so much of the computer science and computer 
technology communities.  It is the basic, incredibly simple, point of 
view that computers *are* mathematics brought to life.  They are 
dazzling, radical, explosive engines, and about all we do is yoke 
them and use them to pull wagons.

Passive Rendering
So what we discovered early on in this project, is that almost none 
of these systems make it easy to get the font metrics needed for 
laying out text.  Why?  Well usually the text was being laid out in 
some other system -- a text editor, or a web page design program, and 
everything was already composed when it got to the browser.

Active Objects
But where we are coming from is that text, like everything else in 
the system is *alive*, there on the screen.  If you tweak it it will 
respond.  And for that, of course you need the font metrics right 
then and there.  Of course we have figured ways around this for each 
implementation, but the fact that we have had to tells you taht we 
are having to drag ourselves out of the dark ages again.  We had all 
this stuff working fine and simply over three decades ago in 
Smalltalk and other similar dynamic computing environments.

Active Architecture
The passive stagnation goes deeper, too.  For instance, if you look 
at the node structure of SVG and some other similar systems, you find 
a distinction between primitive nodes and more general nodes that 
admit of easy change.  There is a real theory of active computing 
that says:  You can cheat for efficiency, but don't let yourself get 
caught.  Thus in Smalltalk small integers are hard coded, but it is 
all handled seamlessly so you can still send messages to them, you 
can multiply them until they become extended precision, but the 
programs that work with them never have to know the difference. 
Similarly, you want to be able edit primitive shapes like ellipses, 
but how are you going to out handles on them if they can't have 
aubparts.  This is what an architecture like Morphic provides.  It 
gives even the simplest shapes the ability to be manipulated as 
full-fledged components in the architecture, and it retains all the 
malleability and scriptability on screen in the browser where most 
other software is passive or, even where active, not@all 
open-ended.

So the passion behind this Lively thing is to keep things active and 
open-ended in every way we can.  It may be slow right now;  it may 
seem primitive;  but static it ain't.


What's new
I said in my test message that good things are happening.

Fabrik
Jens Lincke, who was an intern with us for a couple of months in the 
summer (on loan from the Hasso-Plattner Institute in Potsdam), built 
a Fabrik-like system in LK.  It doesn't quite have Fabrik's clean 
dataflow model and the timeless iterators, but it is a fun 
environment for building UI-intensive applications, and much more 
could be done with it.  Robert Krahn, also from HPI, was also a 
contributor to this project.

Wiki
Robert is still working with us, and his summer project was to build 
a client-side Wiki of active objects.  He did this by hooking LK's 
page saving logic via WebDAV protocol to an SVN repository.  This 
allows one to keep saving new versions of a world, but with the 
ability to revert to earlier versions@any time.

We are planning to build our web site in that system in the coming 
month, a project we hope will be fun for all and instructive too.

Gradients, styles and other appearance tweaks
You'll get to see this when we push our next release (qv).

Refactoring of shape / Multiple implementations
Krzysztof has done lots of work refactoring the relationship between 
our Morphic architecture and that of SVG and other implementations. 
Around the time of the release, we should have more to say about some 
of the other implementations we have running.


What's next
Yes!  A new release is forthcoming.  We hope to have it out around 
December 10th, with documentation evolving through that month as we 
expand our web site.

A web site in our own wiki
We plan to get serious about Robert's wiki and actually build our web 
site using it.

Hosting
We are hoping to enable anyone with an account on this email system 
to be able to save Lively content in a modest repository here@Sun, 
and to have interesting projects promoted to a shared archive.  We 
will learn about the scalability of this project before long.  If 
anyone out there has a good idea about how to do this if 100,000 
people get interested, I'd like to know.

A fun PR hack that may or may not happen
I can't tell you about this yet but, if it happens, you'll know 
around December 10th (I hope earlier).

A real IDE
Robert has been working hard to improve the IDE that i built last 
spring in LK.  We will write about it in January and, hopefully, get 
some of you interested in making it a real web programmer's power 
tool.


That's it for now.  I'm curious to hear people's reactions to all of 
this, and also to find out what people are doing with the Lively 
Kernel, and where they would like to see it go.

Fitts' Law says if it is further away and smaller it will take longer to 
get there. And that only works if you can see it, which you can't for LK 
handles.

What if the whole object was the target and when you got your mouse 
cursor on it, you got a pie menu with up to eight choices, and secondary 
menus when more choices are needed. Wouldn't that be quicker to get to 
and more learnable for novices so they can become experts more quickly.

Some basic documentation might also be nice, although when the wiki is 
available, I expect that questions and answers will quickly satisfy my 
needs.

Folks -

As many of you will have noticed, we have moved most of our activity 
to a Trac-based Wiki and SVN repository.

The upside of this is that if you want to run our very latest code 
all you have to do is click on...

	http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/source/kernel/index.xhtml

This will throw several errors with huge notifiers on the screen, but 
you just click OK and they go away.  The notifiers are a result of 
not having proxies for some off-site web references, and we haven't 
taken the time to tone down them down yet.

This will give you a taste of what's to come in 0.9 or whatever we 
call this release we're planning to do in December.  You will find 
lots of stuff that we can talk about in the coming little while:  A 
bit of Fabrik, a bit of Tile Scripting, a bit of Pie menus, and a bit 
more spiffiness like gradients, drop shadows in the hand, animated 
window collapse, etc.

Also,@that same URL (http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/), you can 
get to the sources, read the history and  updates as they come along, 
and maybe even find some documentation.

Naturally, we plan to make all of this beautiful and well-documented, 
but we keep finding more urgent or more entertaining things to do 
:-(.  That's where you come in.  Needless to say, we're always 
interested in contributions to our appearance, documentation and 
code.  Now that you have better access, perhaps you'll get sucked 
into some of this fun.

	- Dan, as scribe

PS:  Those comments about the name in my earlier message.  I didn't 
really mean them.  I've spent too much time with the trademark 
lawyers already.  I just mean we *think* of it as "Lively".  You knew 
that.

You should have quite some fun firing up the latest LK as per my 
earlier message.

	http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/source/kernel/index.xhtml
	(click OK in the huge error notices)

You will find a 'use pie menus'  item in the world menu under 
'preferences' (if it isn't pretty self-explanatory I want to know). 
You know I've been a gesture fan since I put them ("GestureMenus") in 
Fabrik about a quarter century ago ;-).  You may want to go into the 
'simple example morphs' world to play around with them.

>Some basic documentation might also be nice, although when the wiki is
>available, I expect that questions and answers will quickly satisfy my

Also you'll find a 'help' item in the world menu that will offer 
'command key help' and take you to text editor help in our TRAC wiki. 
It's a start.

Enjoy

You get it by clicking where there are no objects on the screen, and 
with the alt key pressed (on non-Macs, it may require a different 
control key).  It looks like...


We are in the process of producing a tutorial entirely in the Lively 
Kernel.  It should lead you carefully through each necessary step.  I 
wrote this assuming that you already knew some basics.

Back on our original web site...

	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/

... there is a tab labelled 'Interactive Tutorial'  that should guide 
you through some of the basics.  I jumped past these in order to tell 
you about our pie menus, and I guess that was a bit premature.  If 
you have not tried this, please do.  Your comments will help to guide 
us in producing the next version entirely in LK.

Yes.  We are indeed sorely cursed in this regard.  We take your 
critique and cautions as serious exhortation to do the job right, and 
get people to a competent and creative point in a simple and direct 
manner.

Perhaps.  We're hoping we can introduce everything from within the 
system itself, along the lines of the existing interactive tutorial. 
We'll see (and you can be the judge).

By the way, you will find a  link to the Lively Kernel talk@Google 
( a demo, not a tutorial)

process of disclosure here.  There is more to come, and I hope that 
we can make it much more effective.

Folks -

We've been having a lot of fun (and pushing the system in many good  
ways), by building an Advent Calendar thing in the Lively Kernel.   
It's a bit geeky but,@the same time, it's cooler than many other  
things on the web. @this point we probably can't catch up with the  
dates enough to release it as such, but we're still having fun with  
it.  We thought you might like it too and -- who knows -- maybe even  
contribute something.

Anyway, the thing is out there, we're adding to it each day and, if  
you do something cool, it could help us finish before the 25th.  As of  
this writing, days 1-4 have content, and there's a plan for days  
through the 12th.  Check it out at...

	http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/calendar0.xhtml

In case you can't tell, after the holidays most of these pages will  
remain as an introduction to the Lively Kernel built in itself.  The  
goal is for people to learn a bit and play a bit on each page.  For  
that reason especially, we'd like feedback to help make it be an  
effective (and fun) tutorial.

Enjoy

	- Dan

PS:  If you're wondering about the "wiki" controls, this works as a  
client-side wiki for us (letting us save and revert as we develop the  
site), but that aspect will only work for people with accounts on our  
repository.

Hi,

I'm trying to grasp the MVC pattern in LK. There seems to be
alternative approaches for constructing the model.@least
subclassing the Model class and using Records.

I'd appreciate if someone could explain the motivations of the
different approaches. I'd be also very interested in your assessment
of the stability of the current implementation, and of course possible
future plans.

After some experiments and reading the code, I've got the impression
that the Records approach is suitable when the model is a simple data
model and you can use the Record's getter/setter magic. And when the
model is more complex and should contain some logic, you should
subclass Model. Please comment weather this is to the point or not.

BR,
Juhani R?nkimies

Hi Junani,
	the current codebase is indeed confusing in this area, mostly because  
it contains two different architectures for MVC, the new one and the  
old one, preserved for compatibility (since not all the code has been  
ported to the new architecture).
	In both the new and the old architecture, in principle every object  
can act as a Model. Objects not specifically designed to be models can  
act as models, as long some of their methods are designated as model  
variable getters and setters. Those model variables may or may not  
correspond to actual JavaScript properties, i.e., they may be  
computed. The View.connectModel() method specifies which  concrete  
JavaScript methods of the model object act as getters and setters of  
the View's abstract model (*).
	But since any object can be a model, there's no universal mechanism  
for the model to notify views that a model value has changed. To  
address this need, the old mechanism provides the Model class, which  
keeps track of the views it's connected to (its dependents), and  
notifies them when its variable values change. The new mechanism  
doesn't use Model any more, and instead relies on the Record class,  
which itself doesn't know anything about MVC, but it knows how to  
notify observers when its property values change. Thus Record is a  
convenient Model, but not every Model has to be a Record (Records  
could also be used independently of the MVC pattern). On the other  
hand, Records currently do not support computed variables, and so for  
every getter/setter pair there is a JavaScript property defined in the  
Record instance.

	In terms of specific examples, NetRequest typically uses a model that  
is not a Record, since it only writes to the model and is typically  
not interested in receiving updates when model values change. The  
WeatherWidget, on the other hand, uses a Record for its model, because  
its views are interested in receiving notifications when model  
variables change.
	
	I hope this is useful, if not, please keep asking. As far as the  
stability of the implementation, well, I think there's room to  
simplify and generalize the new MVC architecture, although it's  
already used quite extensively by Fabrik and other parts of the  
system. Ideally the old MVC architecture would be phased out and  
pruned from the codebase, but it hasn't happened yet.

	Krzysztof


(*) I try to use the words 'formal' and 'actual' in this context, in  
analogy to function invocation terminology: every View has its own  
notion of what its model is, and uses formal model variable names,  
much like a function body uses formal argument names. When the Model  
is connected to the View, the model's variables are in a way similar  
to actual arguments of a function invocation. The Model-View hookup  
provides a mapping between View's model variables (formals) and the  
getters and setters of the Model (actuals), much like a function  
invocation creates a mapping between formal and actual arguments.

Thank you for the information, it is useful.

My project has a model that is a graph of objects, where changing one
object may propagate changes to other objects in the graph. Some
attributes are computed. There is a need to connect and disconnect
Views to different objects of the graph, depending on which portions
of the model the user wants to view and manipulate.

Currently I'm subclassing Model. I tried to use Records as the Model,
but quickly ran into problems with subclassing the Record. A Record
object is usually instantiated with Record.newPlainInstance(spec) or
Record.newDOMInstance(spec), which, if I understand correctly,
generate a new class with properties, getters and setters, according
to the information in spec, and then create an instance of the new
class.

Wouldn't it be easy to add something like Record.newPlainClass(spec)?
(at least if the default values for the properties are ignored)
It could then be used like this:

Record.newPlainClass(spec).subclass('MyModelClass', ...);

where MyModelClass could define functionality around the generated
getters and setters.

BR,
Juhani

I experimented by modifying Base.js:
- added Record.newPlainClass, Record.newNodeClass, Record.newClass
- modified Record.newPlainInstance, Record.newNodeInstance and
Record.newInstance

Quick test with Record.newPlainClass and Record.newPlainInstance worked.

The modification is on SVN revision 2415 and it potentially breaks
something because I changed the signature of Record.newInstance.

I dare to say my Quinto with Etoys in six lines of code in Etoys is  
simpler than the SBE-version.

http://www.squeakland.org/launcher/?http://www.emergent.de/pub/smalltalk/squeak/projects/lightson.pr

The trick is to make the layout so that neighboring cells overlap each  
other a bit.
Then make the corners of the cells rounded so that diagonal neighbors  
do not overlap.

BUT: for using my or the SBE version one still needs to install sth.  
first -- even if it's Squeak... ;-)
Not so if you used JavaScript:
http://cappuccino.org/learn/demos/LightsOff/

(Official name for Quinto seems to be "Lights out", but everyone seems  
to have his or her own version...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(video_game) )

Dan Ingalls and other great folks bring the power of tile scripting  
and visual composition to "No-Install"-JavaScript with "lively kernel".
(google for lively sun / I am cross-posting to their list)

Their "lights out" will turn some lights on. Or will it be you who  
does it?

Cheers

Hi everyone,

the Lively Wiki has a new tutorial which demonstrates how to create  
own projects with JavaScript and the LK tools:
http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/livelyScriptingTutorial.xhtml

This will allow you to create projects like these:
http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/kal1.xhtml
http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/livelyMausefalle.xhtml
http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/!svn/bc/10624/happyNewYear.xhtml

It would be great if you could create a user account (http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/index.fcgi/register 
) and add one or more projects to the wiki. This does not only allow  
us to find out how well the wiki scales but it also helps to find bugs  
(http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/ 
bugReports.xhtml).

See you in the wiki,
Robert

1. Does the Wiki actually retain revisions? My main wiki page now freezes
every time I load it.

http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/pweaver.xhtml

I've noticed a few other wiki pages doing this as well. I tried connecting
via WebDav directly in the Finder but I don't see any revisions and it also
does not authenticate with my user/pass.

2. How do I invoke the IDE?

3. How might I map my right mouse button to the alt/option key for the
contextual menus? I believe this question was previously unanswered earlier
on the list. I'll research online but I want to ask. Having to use the alt
key is killing me. :-)

Lively is outstanding. (More promising than Flex, Cappuccino, Sprout, Ext)
There is no comparison and Lively is in a totally different league. I
understand the potential and the vision here. There's much more creative
potential for us to incorporate but Lively is indeed marvelous.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <ad622aba0902220122k20110ff1v7dd854aadda2b739@mail.gmail.com>
Status: O

These are just a few software apps I've been using recently with
some concepts I like and would like to share. Some of this is potentially
very distant and beyond the current scope of Lively. But these are some
things what I would like to personally work toward in Lively.

1. DrawIt (http://www.bohemiancoding.com/?DrawIt#Compose)

DrawIt is an exquisite, novel drawing application which I recently
purchased. The app can occasionally be cumbersome but its more usable once
you get used to it. The shape/layer navigator is pretty cool but even better
is how every sort of element attribute is accumulated by drag and drop on
the right - instead of having too many palettes and inspectors.

2. Bento (http://www.filemaker.com/products/bento/)

Bento is a personal database and organizer. I wish the Mac Finder worked
more like Bento. My favorite feature of Bento is the ratings field. I wish
that I could attach a rating to any object of my filesystem as an attribute
or to any element in a Lively world. Beats filing. Ratings and tagging.

3. iWork Numbers (http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/)

My favorite Numbers feature is that spreadsheet tables can be spread out all
over a sheet. Before Numbers was released I had imagined spreadsheets as
opening a new window from a folder like in the Mac Finder. Tying this in to
the concept of subworld is pretty interesting to me - where each subworld
could return a calculated value.

4. Web Pages

I don't want to ignore vertical scrolling like web documents are able to
scroll. One of my initial goals with Lively is to also enable a document
feel using vertical scrolling. I realize that in the future Lively could
support a zoomable UI but I want to do this anyway. I want to explore a
traditional web document feel in Lively and scroll wheel support be nice to
have as well.

Hi Philip,

> 1. Does the Wiki actually retain revisions? My main wiki page now  
> freezes every time I load it.

Unfortunately with a slow internet connection it can happen that a  
default LK world is created in the background (when the scripts are  
loaded but the data of the page isn't yet there). When the page is  
then saved problems appear, e.g. the page freezes when reloaded. This  
happened with your page. We are working on that problem.

Anyway, to revert a page visit http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/revertOtherWorlds.xhtml 
  There are two little scripts for that. We plan to add this  
functionality to the tooling soon.

> 2. How do I invoke the IDE?

Open the world menu by right clicking in the background. In the sub  
menu 'Tools' you will find all sorts of useful things. The  
SystemBrowser for instance allows you to browse the code base and edit  
the ChangeSet for the world. Visit http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/livelyScriptingTutorial.xhtml 
  to find a little (and unfortunately incomplete) tutorial about this  
topic.

I changed the way menus are created and the right and middle mouse  
click should now open a menu.

In Firefox and Webkit the right click works fine but Safari the mouse  
movement stops. Use the middle button instead or to choose a menu item  
*press and hold* your left mouse button.

Thank you. Btw. your page looks amazing, keep it coming!

I want some code to execute every time my world opens on the wiki. Is this
possible? I have done this locally already by altering my local copy of

I'm basically trying to incorporate my own examples and demo into my

instead just need to host my own page?

Hi Philip,

paste and select your scripts in a Wiki World. Then open a context  
menu, go to 'Text functions...' and choose 'add as preamble to current  
ChangeSet' or 'add as postscript to current ChangeSet'.

When you have new Morph definitions and instances of those Morphs  
should be saved with the page, put the definitions in the preamble  
(because the preamble is evaluated before the World is serialized). If  
you have scripts which are accessing the WorldMorph or its submorphs  
than put those into the postscript.

You can than view and change the ChangeSet by opening the  
SystemBrowser and choose 'ChangeSet for World' in the left pane (at  
the bottom).

Robert

Actually, looking as this error text again: do I need to "install" my class
in the system? RatingMorph is a subclass of Morph which I am
defining/evaluating dynamically and I'm now guessing that's why it freaks
out when deserializing. ?

Hi Phil,

I have saved your page so that the morph is deserialized correctly. I  
did this by selecting the class definitions of RatingMorph and  
RatingStarMorph, opened a text menu and selected 'text functions...'--

How do I attach a mouse handler to a morph? Most of the time I have no idea
what can be edited in the inspector: for instance how would I edit [object
Object]?. I did locate mouseHandler in the inspector; I type a little script
down below, accept changes, but that doesn't help. Overall I do think that
"Add Handler" needs to be added to each morphs menu instead of having to
scroll through the inspector.

> How do I attach a mouse handler to a morph?

Open an inspector on a morph then, to attach a new submorph on every  
click e.g., type something like this:

// make sure the Morph really wants the event
this.handlesMouseDown = Functions.True;
// overwrite my onMouseDown method
this.onMouseDown = function (evt) {
	var localPoint = this.localize(evt.mousePoint);
	var new Morph = Morph.makeRectangle(localPoint.extent(pt(10,10)));
	this.addMorph(); // because we manually define a method
}.bind(this);

Other Mouse handler methods: onMouseMove, onMouseUp

Multiple possibilities, assume x is an object

- If you have an instance of a class and want to know its methods
x.constructor.functionNames() // constructor is the klass

- If you have an object (instance or normal JS object) try
Object.keys(x);
Object.values(x);
for (var name in x) { console.log(name + ': ' + x[name]) }

- If you want to look@the source code open the SystemBrowser
In Core.js e.g. the fundamental parts of Morphic are defined.
You can also hit loadAll. Then enter in a TextMorph 'onMouseDown',  
select it and hit alt+w. You will get a list of all occurrences of  
onMouseDown in the source code.

What's very confusing about the inspector is that the area on the right is
editable. If properties on the right are not persistable, then the right
should probably not be editable. I think I understand better.

So to alter an instance or class of a morph, a user must enter code in the
bottom area of the inspector window? And then do what: accept changes?
evaluate as JavaScript?

In a previous attempts I didn't have luck accepting/persisting changes to

I'm beginning to tinker with editing system code via the code browser. In my
view, as a new user, some of the best candidates for tweaking are the
actions in the popup menu: create rectangle but instead green, create text
morph but instead with stickies colors, open code browser with larger
bounds. However none of these actions are exposed to the code browser
individually - you instead have to edit the entire method: subMenuItems. So
it would be nice if this method was instead a new set of classes (perhaps
grouped in a namespace for grouping in the code browser). The subMenuItems
method even has an existing comment: // FIXME this boilerplate code should
be abstracted somehow.
I think this is very important for new users to quickly understand using the
code browser. Perhaps I will refactor that method over the next few days -
but if anyone runs with this this let me know.

Also, aside: I could never find Morph.makeRectangle in the code browser.

Hi Phil,

inspector changes are persistent now and the image of the tutorial you  
mentioned doesn't show the inspector but the CodeBrowser, an older  
version of the SystemBrowser.

The makeRectangle is a class method of morph. Open a SystemBrowser,  
click on Core.js. enter makeRectangle in a text field, select it and  
hit alt+w (for searching the source, also available in the context  
menu under Text functions). You will then see an item 'Core.js:3165:  
propertyDef:Morph>>makeRectangle:'

Hi, Phil -

I agree that this needs to be cleaned up.  Since it's under  
discussion, there are a number of things to be unified around menus,  
buttons, and actions:

* Menus should be able to be "nailed" -- ie remain on screen like a  
set of buttons

* Menu items should be able to be torn off and function as a buttons,  
and buttons should be able to be dropped into menus.

* Menu items/buttons should be able to be "inspected" to reveal the  
code for their action and also help regarding what they do (of course  
these are the same if the code is well written.

* Codewise, actions should be unified using JavaScript functions.  I'm  
guilty of having put in the more verbose form of receiver/messaage/ 
args constructs;  these should be replaced unless we decide they are  
better for some reason.

* While we're@it, SchedulableActions used in the scheduler for  
alarms and repetitive actions should similarly be unified.

* Any Morph should be able to be made into a "button" -- ie, to lose  
its normal mouse response and simply become a button.

* And of course we need to decide how many kinds of buttons we want to  
support -- toggles, act on down, act on up (with roll-out escape), etc.

* The current links in text should also function consistently with  
buttons.

-------------------

Naturally the same kinds of comments refer to other things that can be  
taken apart.  Can you grab a class pane out of the system browser for  
use any time you want to browse that class?  Etc, etc.

This is why it's hard to "finish" a system.

Anyway, thanks for your interest and useful feedback on these topics.   
You will soon be used to how everything works and hence worthless as a  
critic ;-)

	- Dan

I do like buttons over select all, alt-d! :-) I was thinking about that some
- but I decided that I'm just going to work with customizing the existing
MenuMorph to start since it's already there. I did rewrite the main
subMenuItems method and broke it down into smaller classes in:
lively.menus.xxxxx. I did this to make it easier to tweak those menu
actions via the code browser and to add my own submenus. I hope to ask for
input/acceptance etc.
Dan, I don't understand the reference to "unified" below. Are you basically
referring to sharable actions? I am a super fan of the Actions API from
Swing.

I don't normally use FF but I dug around in FireBug. I now understand that
every morph is already contained inside an SVG group. I suppose I just need
to hack something like this:
rawNode.style.setProperty('opacity', '0.2');

But I'm not entirely sure how to access the g node of each morph though
(this.node, this.rawNode, this.shape?) I'll keep playing - getting closer I
think.

Anyway, feedback: it would be nice if every Morph supported setOpacity to be
able to affect the opacity of each item in that group (including their
images).

That was pretty simple to hack. But Lively still may need
morph.setOpacity().
ImageMorph.subclass("enhanced.ImageMorph", {

this.rawNode.style.setProperty('opacity', '0.2');
this.setFillOpacity(0.0);

I created two wiki pages with very simple ChangeSets. This simplest one
works fine when I evaluate the text in the TextMorph.

This one fails with a type error when I evaluate the text in the TextMorph..

I am almost there - getting productive. Thank you so much for your help

for instantiation, cool animated vortex widget for world navigation,
ScrollPane for the world, Flickr gallery widget, buttons, stickies, morph

prioritize between utility in Lively/Morphic and bling.

Hi,

sorry I forgot to inform you. I already added the opacity setter/ 
getter to ImageMorph yesterday. You can now do stuff like:

x = new ImageMorph(new Rectangle(45, 45, 49, 49),  
URL.source.withFilename('mouse.png').toString());
x.openInWorld();
x.setOpacity(0.3)

Hi Phil,

the expression fails because you do not pass in the current  
WorldMorph. When you do that (http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/testworld.xhtml 
) then everything works fine.

Like I mentioned before you can use this.setOpacity(0.3); instead of  
this.rawNode.style.setProperty('opacity', '0.3');

Status: O

As I work with Lively, I am primarily creating widgets as classes. However
any of these widgets could have been laid out directly in the world using
the existing morph primitives. The reason I did not do this is because 1. I
have not found a way to convert a morph composite to a class 2. nor have I
found a way to serialize and deserialize the morphs of a singular widget to
be used with a class. So I will continue to build widgets as classes and
then interact with them as entities via script evals. A significant
distinction appears to exist in Lively between writing classes in the ide
and interacting with objects using the inspector. I regret that I am not
very familiar with Squeak and Smalltalk.
I wish I could click on an instantiated morph and select either "New
subclass" (even "Change class"). The Lively ide then creates a new subclass
and the morph composite is either 1. constructed by deserialization (think
interface builder and nib files) or 2. the necessary code is generated in
the initializer to reconstruct the child morphs. Please let me know if any
of this is currently possible. If not I'm sure soon it can be. :-)

I assigned a value to a custom property on a Morph. After I save the world

that I wrote a new layout manager, have been attaching constraints to

How do I persist the custom properties of a Morph?

Hi Phil,

can you give an example?

Deserialization should work for common values (but not for all  
objects). In http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/testworld3.xhtml 
  I assigned values to the red rectangle (testValue, testValue2).

I'm done some more digging. It appears that I just need to use models. I
found what I think are good examples
in CheapListMorph.initialize/getSelection/setSelection) and I found
ViewTrait in Core.js. I don't think I really need or want to use the Widget
class atm but I see that many of the examples which use it. I'm just trying
to store layout constraint info with a morph when it gets serialized. I'll
post a code example if I don't get models working.
Thank Robert.

Actually I realized that in this case I probably don't need models@all -
I probably just need to reinitialize the layout constraints when each
submorph is initialized from persistent state. I've only been using
initialize (and not initializePersistenState) and that's the problem. I'll
study examples and the code some more - duh.

Status: O

I struggled with a very simple yet important subject and I just want to post
a possible solution here. I wanted to persist some simple values when one of
my morph instances was persisted. I am not using the Widgets class@this
time. My goal is persist some layout constraints on a morph.
The Morph class does extend from lively.data.Wrapper. lively.data.Wrapper
provides methods for setTrait and getTrait which do store and restore
automatically when a Morph is serialized and deserialized.

Another approach may be to use models. Because I'm not really yet using the
Widgets class I don't really have models working yet. There appears to be no
documentation yet for using models except for Examples.js.

Hi Phil,

the getTrait and setTrait methods are used by shapes, not morphs. All  
instance variables of morphs are persistent a priori. I modified your  
test code a bit:

Morph.subclass("MyPersistedMorph", {
	
	handlesMouseDown : Functions.True,
	
	initialize : function($super) {
		
		console.log('PersistedMorph.initialize');
		$super(new lively.scene.Rectangle(new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200)));
		
		this.setFill(Color.green);
		console.log('PersistedMorph.initialize weight: ' + this.weight); //  
will always be undefined because
									// initialize isn't called for deserialization
	},
	
	onDeserialize: function() {
		console.log('PersistedMorph.onDeserialize weight: ' +  
this.weight); // This works
	},
	onMouseDown : function($super, event) {
		
		console.log('PersistedMorph.onMouseDown');
		console.log('PersistedMorph.onMouseDown weight: ' + this.weight);
		this.weight = 100;
		
		return true;
	}
});

I refocused on your other response about persisting common values but not
common objects. Until I discover how to persist one of my own Object
subclasses, I'm just sort of unpackaging and repackaging my complex objects
on the morph for now and I have that working. I'm probably making things too
difficult by not using models and the Widget class but I'll revisit those
soon. Everything will get easier when I embrace coding directly inside a
World - I keep going back and forth between my local editor and the wiki.

Yep, we really don't have enough documentation.

If the question might be interesting for other people the mailing list  
is probably the best option.

> 2. (the real question) I can't seem to have changes to a class  
> persist. Specifically...

This is because no changes to object/function/class definitions are  
saved. If you want to change the behavior you have to add a  
redefinition to the world's ChangeSet. E.g. consider that you have:  
TextMorph.doLinkThing = function() { console.log('Link clicked') }.  
Select the source code, open a context menu and go to 'Text  
functions...' and choose 'add as preamble to current ChangeSet'. When  
you save and reload the page the order in which things are loaded is  
the following:

1. LK source code
2. ChangeSet preamble
3. WorldMorph and it's submorphs
4. ChangeSet postscript

This means that things in the preamble are evaluated before morphs are  
deserialized, allowing to add new morph subclasses, and the postscript  
thereafter, letting you manipulate the world.

You can add any number of class changes, proto changes (methods and  
property, belonging to a class change or being separate), static  
changes (changes to any object), and doit changes (simply some source  
code) as well as one preamble and one postscript element.

Right now write permissions are only set for xhtml files but we are  
thinking about changing that.

How does a user configure a server to allow saving a Lively world? Is it
possible to save a world if loading a file directly from the filesystem?  Up
until now I've been calling my own code from Main.js when working locally -
and without persistence.

All of the following is based on a checkout I did about a week ago.

In brazil.config
    Changed port to 80.  (was 8081)
    Uncommented proxy lines.
In defaultconfig.js
    Changed port to 80. (was 8081)
Ran 'runbrazil.sh' as root.
Load index.xhtml
    Can't load Pen.lkml
    Can't load finance.google.com
    Can't load download.finance.yahoo.com
    Can't load feeds.bbc.co.uk.com

I edited brazil.config and added: mime.lkml=text/xml
Pen.lkml now loads when I refer to it directly.

These are the lines I had uncommented in brazil.config for the proxy
handling.
 proxymap.class=sunlabs.brazil.handler.UrlMapperHandler
proxymap.match=^/proxy/(.*)
 proxymap.replace=http://\\1
proxy.class=sunlabs.brazil.proxy.ProxyHandler

Tried to access directly:
http://127.0.0.1/trunk/source/kernel/proxy/www.apple.com
Got the error: Not Found
while trying to obtain /trunk/source/kernel/proxy/www.apple.com

Up until now I've been calling my own code from Main.js when working
locally. I will keep working in the wiki online but I'd feel like less of a
wiki spammer if I get this running locally. I also need to be able to test
locally with persistence.@some point I'd also like to be able to host
(displaying a Lively badge of course). :-)

Errata: Otherwise if I load the world directly from the filesystem and
select "publish world as", I see Null value Core.js line 719. Not sure if
Lively is meant to work this way though. :-)

addSystemDictionary: function(doc) {
var dict = lively.data.Wrapper.dictionary;
 if (!dict) return;
var preExisting = doc.getElementById(dict.id); // <-----------------------
Core.js line 719
 if (preExisting)
preExisting.parentNode.removeChild(preExisting);
var newDict = dict.cloneNode(true);
 doc.getElementsByTagName('svg')[0].appendChild(doc.importNode(newDict,
true));
},

I've made some more progress.
In brazil.config, change main.handlers to:
     main.handlers=session proxymap proxy template file

In defaultconfig.js: (maybe even localconfig.js)
     proxyURL: 'http://127.0.0.1/proxy/', (error with
http://127.0.0.1:80/proxy/)

When I try to authenticate, the WikiNavigator can not be found. This is
likely because in Main.js, the WikiNavigator is initialized only if the
page/world has serialized contents.

If any of this is documented somewhere or if other config files exist I've
missed it.

I tweaked Main.js so the wiki navigator is enabled even if the world has no
serialized contents:

if (documentHasSerializedMorphs(document)) {
 ... snip ...
} else {
world = new WorldMorph(canvas);
 // Create an empty world
world.displayOnCanvas(canvas);
if (Config.showWikiNavigator) {
 require('LKWiki.js').toRun(function() {
console.log('starting WikiNavigator');
 WikiNavigator.enableWikiNavigator();
});
}
 }

But console.log('starting WikiNavigator') is never called and I see the
following in the console:

http://127.0.0.1/trunk/source/kernel/anonymous_module_0 has unloaded
requirements: http://127.0.0.1/trunk/source/kernel/LKWiki.js

I realized to look over here:
http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/localconfig.jsArgh.
This should be somewhere in lively-kernel/trunk as wikiConfig.js or
something.

What I wrote earlier about moving the code for 'showWikiNavigator' was
probably wrong.

I'll try to go through all of this again and write some instructions. The
main problems I've encountered I think were

   - configuring brazil.config
   - localconfig.js for the wiki is not part of:
   http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/ - and
   this is where I had checkout from. Finally realized to look
   in repository/lively-wiki

Hi, Phil -

Our apologies that some of these details are not better documented or  
indexed.  We applaud your persistence, and it would be great if you  
would share the fruits of that persistence with the rest of the list  
when you are done.

We've been a bit distracted with a couple of new developments around  
LK, but I think all will be interested as soon as they are ready to  
share.

Keep up the good work, and best regards

	- Dan, for the team

I don't normally save/publish worlds, but@some point I tested and
successfully saved a world using the apache mod_dav.
My configuration that looks something like this.

...
LoadModule dav_module modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_fs_module modules/mod_dav_fs.so
...

Alias /lk "C:/lk"

<Location /lk>
    Dav On

Hi, Phil -

This is not exactly what you are asking for, but...

For the faster JavaScript, and somewhat advanced graphics, I run the latest Webkit nightly builds.  They are extremely compatible with Safari, and it's easy to have both Safari and Webkit on the same machine -- in fact Webkit looks just like Safari, and will inherit all your history, bookmarks, etc.

Sadly, Webkit has the same bug that causes S4 to crash sometimes with Lively, but it has its strengths when not crashing.

Hope this helps

	- Dan

PS:  If you like nightly builds, check out the MineField nightly builds -- FireFox with TraceMonkey JS.

Message-ID: <ad622aba0903190904w4e6e0380n891138be759d09f7@mail.gmail.com>
Status: O

In my own hosted Lively sometimes my worlds don't open properly - it appears
that a world is loading underneath or to the side of my world and the hand
works for that region but not for the deserialized morphs. Sometimes this
can be intermittent. For a couple of periods this has been continuous to
where every time I load a world it is always "frozen" (it appears that a
world is loading underneath or to the side of my world). The issue persists
even when I clear my cache and restart. No errors in the console. When this
begins to occur it affects ever one of my existing worlds.
I have already reinstalled once but this has come back. So my main question
is: what is going on that could be causing the hand to operate outside the
bounds of the deserialized morphs/deserialize world?

My local config is:

Config.askBeforeQuit = false;
Config.showWikiNavigator = false;
Config.skipMostExamples = true;
Config.skipAllExamples = true;
Config.showCurveExample = false;
Config.showGridDemo = false;

Also, when I do see the world underneath, it looks like it's loading the
examples even though skipAllExamples had been set to true in localconfig.js.

This is just a hunch. I'm going to try omitting localconfig.js and only
editing defaultconfig.js.
There are some other considerations that shouldn't matter: My Mac's Apache
installation is not configured exactly the same as my hosted site. 2. My
world's reload themselves automatically if stale. I don't think that either
of these should cause the examples to popup in the background. So I'll try
not using a localconfig.js file for a bit more.

Disney's Contemporary Resort, Orlando, Florida

http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/swa/dls/dls-09/

***** Call for papers *****

The 5th Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS)@OOPSLA 2009 is a forum for 
discussion of dynamic languages, their implementation and application. 
While mature dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, 
Prolog, and APL continue to grow and inspire new converts, a new 
generation of dynamic scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, 
Tcl, and JavaScript are successful in a wide range of applications. DLS 
provides a place for researchers and practitioners to come together and 
share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for future research and 
development.

DLS 2009 invites high quality papers reporting original research, 
innovative contributions or experience related to dynamic languages, 
their implementation and application. Accepted Papers will be published 
in the ACM Digital Library.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

* Innovative language features and implementation techniques
* Development and platform support, tools
* Interesting applications
* Domain-oriented programming
* Very late binding, dynamic composition, and runtime adaptation
* Reflection and meta-programming
* Software evolution
* Language symbiosis and multi-paradigm languages
* Dynamic optimization
* Hardware support
* Experience reports and case studies
* Educational approaches and perspectives
* Object-oriented, aspect-oriented, and context-oriented programming

=== Submissions and proceedings ===

We invite original contributions that neither have been published 
previously nor are under review by other refereed events or 
publications. Research papers should describe work that advances the 
current state of the art. Experience papers should be of broad interest 
and should describe insights gained from substantive practical 
applications. The program committee will evaluate each contributed paper 
based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality.

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

Papers are to be submitted electronically@
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dls2009 in PDF format. 
Submissions must not exceed 12 pages and need to use the ACM format, 
templates for which can be found@
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html.

=== Important dates ===

Submission of papers: June 1, 2009 (hard deadline)
Author notification: July 13, 2009

Subject: [General] Good News:  Canvas Port
Message-ID: <A9A1D1DE-B79A-44BE-8F8C-9109B4B7A8EB@Sun.com>
Status: O

Folks -

We have just put together a port of The Lively Kernel that uses the  
Canvas graphics API instead of SVG.  This means potentially better  
browser support and potentially better performance, though neither is  
the case yet.  We hope you will enjoy helping us to debug this port.   
You can find it at...

	http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/source/kernel/expt.xhtml

... but you need to be running the latest WebKit or MineField, or  
possibly Chrome or Safari 4 beta.

Almost all the graphics works@this point, but there is one  
remaining hole in the implementation.  Up to now, we have been using  
the serialization support in the SVG DOM to save Lively state on web  
pages.  In order to save our state without this SVG support, it will  
be necessary to add a serialization / deserialization package that  
uses another mechanism such as, eg, JSON.  This could be a lot of fun  
for one of our braver community members (ahem).

Try it out.

Tell us about problems.

... and have fun!

	- Dan

To be honest I haven't worked much with Lively, but done a lot of
serialization work ;-)

If not put into SVG anymore, how does state manifest itself in the new version?
Is all state available in the lively objects or would one need to
intercept the Canvas calls to capture the state?
I could image that some state is now in code e.g. by drawing something
with explicit values that are not kept in any variable.

Cheers

Michael

We have just cleared the Lively Kernel for release under the...

	MIT license

Yayyy!

It is our intent now to wrap it all in a shiny new package with 
canvas support, namespaces, wiki work, end-user programming 
frameworks, the great JavaFX experiment, and maybe even a bit of 
documentation(*).


	We need your help

At one time or another, the Lively Kernel has run more or less in 
Safari, Firefox, Opera and even Internet Explorer and a JavaFX 
applet.  And now there are both SVG and Canvas versions as well. We 
need your help testing, locating and, ideally, fixing whatever bugs 
may affect Lively Kernel on each of these platforms.  We are not so 
interested in problems which can be fixed simply by getting a more 
recent version of the same browser, except that we would publish them 
as known problems.  But we are interested in such issues as command 
keys don't work, screen size is wrong, it crashes, etc.

Our goal is for this release to present all the good stuff we've 
done, in a form that runs on as many browsers as possible, on as many 
OS's as possible, in as many countries as possible.

The two files to test are the normal and canvas versions of our 
latest sources...

	http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/source/kernel/index.xhtml
and
	http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/source/kernel/expt.xhtml

Note that the system browser (world menu / tools) will allow you to 
view the entire code base.  If you wish to help with bugs, then 
either send us what you think to be a fix, or contact us regarding 
write access to our repository.

Please send your testing results and suggested fixes, either to me or 
to the list, and I will collect these in a status report and punch 
list of items remaining before we make the release.

Thanks all

	- Dan, for the LK team

(*) If you have developed any useful documentation (such as where in 
the sourcefiles to find various things, etc), please feel free to 
pass those along, and we'll try to fold them into the Wiki and any 
other documentation that we assemble for the release.  Thanks in 
advance for that too.

Canvas support and a new license = totally outstanding. This could change
the game for many in LurkerLand.
I hope this license change gets publicized and evangelized beyond this list.
I did begin an evangelism page if anyone would like to add thought to it:

   - http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/evangelism.xhtml

I hope to take more evangelistic action soon when I'm not coding. :-) But
first a nap.

Great work,

The state of the Lively Kernel is essentially a scene graph, or since you're familiar with Squeak, it's basically a Morphic world.  I believe that all state is accessible in the Morphic tree.

Excellent news!

MIT license is a good choice.I'll try to find time time to upgrade and try
canvas. (I'm currently running on a version from December)

Hi, I'm a newbie here, and will be taking a GLASS (Gemstone Linux  
Apache Seaside Smalltalk) workshop next week@the Santa Fe Complex.
   http://sfcomplex.org/wordpress/2009/03/glass

Dave West, who's sponsoring the workshop, suggested we look@several  
object technologies, including Squeak and LK.

This brings up two questions:

1 - What is the relationship between Squeak and LK?  For example, can  
Squeak on a server "talk" to a browser on a client?  Does it somehow  
integrate into Squeak?

2 - Javascript needs care in handling .. Doug Crockford's nifty book  
Javascript, the Good Parts, along with his website:
   http://javascript.crockford.com/
.. strongly suggests Javascript, when handled correctly, forms a very  
good object platform.  But the trick is building up the subset of the  
language that is useful and safe, and finding the right patterns of  
use that makes it "Squeak-Lite".

So the question is: have you a document showing how to use Javascript  
as you did building LK? How to build a nifty object system out of  
Javascript?  It certainly is a surprising language when you take a  
close look.

Heheh.  One person was a principal in both projects.

Also, LK as it's currently distributed uses the Morphic architecture  
(which came to Squeak from SELF via John Maloney, and thence to LK via  
me)

> For example, can

Yes, but this is more in the Seaside model than LK.  Could you use LK  
to do this?  Again, yes.

>  Does it somehow
> integrate into Squeak?

Does LK?  No.  Not that it couldn't, of course.

> 2 - Javascript needs care in handling .. Doug Crockford's nifty book

Mmm, not sure I like that name but yes, with inspiration from Doug and  
a few ideas of our own, we have a wonderfully usable dynamic object  
model.

Sadly we have not written much about this yet, though all the sources  
are available of course.  Much of the work beginning with the  
Prototype library, and then merging other useful bits was done by  
Krzysztof Palacz in our group.  Along the way we learned a lot about  
various pitfalls and ways to avoid them that would be valuable to  
other travelers on the path.

Maybe if there is a JavaScript conference on Maui...  ;-).

Good to hear from you

Message-ID: <ad622aba0904020812i60fef024ue3aaa2e29898caab@mail.gmail.com>
Status: O

The most significant defect I've seen is that, in
Main.js, documentHasSerializedMorphs will occasionally return false when a
document clearly has serialized morphs. I mostly see this problem when in
the wiki but it's probably not exclusive to the wiki. It's been difficult to
troubleshoot this issue in the wiki however no I'm beginning to try pointing
to my own main and config. This issue probably has something to do with
timing and using(lively.lang.Execution).run but I'm not certain.

I've seen some other issues which I've worked around. I don't need any help
with these but I'm just mentioning them.

One issue was that after saving a world on my hosted server
subsequently every world would hang on load. This could have something to do
with my hosted Apache and WebDav configurations. However, once I removed
references to Examples.js (removed Scratch.js too) every world began to load
again. It's possible that simply the act of saving to WebDav via my
filesystem could have reset WebDav and that removing Examples.js
and Scratch.js was just a coincidence. I was happy to have it finally
working and I haven't revisited. The point of this is that sometime I or we
need to created simpler starter files for Main.js, file.xhtml, and
defaultconfig.js

Another issue I was seeing was local. I was developing a set of pages which
linked among themselves. It was basically unusable because in Safari every
other load the world would freeze - importWorldContents was being called
before the preamble. I finally clued in to disable my cache in Safari. I
solved this issue permanently by overriding Loader.loadJs to always append a
timestamp to script.src and it does work even with caching on.

Loader.loadJs = function(url, onLoadCb, embedSerializable) {
 if (document.getElementById(url)) return;
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.id = url;
script.type = 'text/javascript';
if (Config.disableScriptCaching) {
var date = new Date();
script.src = url + '?' + date.getTime();
} else {
script.src = url;
}
var node = document.getElementsByTagName(embedSerializable ? "defs" :
"script")[0];
if (onLoadCb) script.onload = onLoadCb;
node.appendChild(script);
};

Sincerely,
Philip

Once the contents of Main.js is placed inside window.onload and everything
loads reliably. This seems pretty obvious now.

I found and began to use a straightforward and very friendly JSON data store
which I'm using with some Lively projects:

   - http://www.millstonecw.com/dovetaildb/

DovetailDB is open source Java with an Apache license. You can use the
hosted database or install your own. You can add JavaScript server handlers
for data operations, and install JavaScript stored procedures. You can
easily add access control by defining handlers on the server. It is simple
yet extensible and those are qualities which I've been looking for. Other
Java-based JSON stores are Sun Cloud APIs, FeatherDB and Persevere.

Dear Citizens of Lively, Lurkers, and Lively Team -

I want to wrap up a good release of the Lively Kernel in the next week  
or so.  Here is a list of things that need to be done:

1.  Document everything that's in it.  i don't mean detailed  
documentation, I just mean a "Table of Contents" sort of thing so  
surfers will discover that we have, eg, WebDAV code, SVN access code,  
OMeta parser, etc, plus some pointers to the half-done experiments  
like canvas support, alternative class models, etc.

2.  Bring the home page up to date with regard to such things as  
License, etc.

3.  Fix some known bugs, to wit...

*  Dragging objects through wormholes introduces a y-offset.  I caused  
this while making the canvas version work.

*  Dragging spinning star and other ticking objects through wormholes  
seems to cause extra cals to get put in the scheduler(s), and also  
strange behavior with drop-shadows.

*  [canvas] Would be nice to get enough JSON support working to  
actually save a canvas page and get it back.

*  [canvas] Need some work with damage rectangles or there may be  
errors in some of the browsers.

*  It seems that loading LK no longer works when  
Config.loadSerializedSubworlds = false.  Phil's recent message may  
point to the solution there

*  Track down why LK no longer runs in Chrome, and put in a work- 
around if possible

*  Track down why LK crashes WebKit (and Safari 4 beta), and either  
give them enough info to fix it or put in a work-around if possible

*  Ideally have the release run *well* on the latest releases (and  
those soon to come) of Safari, Firefox and Chrome.

*  Ditto for the canvas version

*Anyone want to get it running in Opera?  We think it mostly does  
except for some JavaScript nits like comma not allowed after last item  
in Array and Object literals.


We could probably use TRAC for this, and I'd be happy if anyone wants  
to transfer these items to TRAC, but for now, I think it's fine to use  
the mail list, and I intend to fix the first two problems related to  
wormholes myself in the next day or two.

Lively Up, Guys and let's make it a great release!

	- Dan

I installed Safari 4 within the past hour. Most of my worlds load fine. The
one which causes Safari 4 to crash has a postscript. Most of the others
(maybe all others) don't. Perhaps this is only an observation and not a
clue. I'll submit more info when it's available.
Also here is a web page which discusses how to allow Safari 4 and Safari 3
coexist on the same system. I have not yet taken these step but probably
will later today.

I don't see any font sizes greater than 24 being applied in the LIvely
codebase. The examples page currently seems to load fine in Safari 4
(5528.16):

Otherwise, all of my worlds seem to be functioning OK (however I'm wrapping

Also saw a crash with another component ("widget")@font size 24 and even
22 - just want to mention it. I understand this could possibly be related
to metrics and that 24 is not a special number. :-)

I "doit" in a clean world in the wiki and no crash. I'll have to
troubleshoot within my codebase to see what else (with setFontSize) might be
causing this. Sorry folks.

TextMorph.subclass('TestTextMorph', {
initialize : function($super) {
$super(new Rectangle(0, 0, 500, 500), 'm');
this.setFontSize(30);
}
});
var testTextMorph = new TestTextMorph();
WorldMorph.current().addMorph(testTextMorph);    // this all works fine as a
doit

I'm still curious where Safari 4 crashing has been seen - the index page and
examples pages seem to work great.

Hi guys -

I just committed a couple of changes that fix problems with stepping  
scripts...

1.  It turns out that if you had a simple stepping morph, like  
spinning star, and you picked it up and then put it down, its drop- 
shadow remained in the scheduler stepping invisibly but not without  
consuming cycles.  One more for every such action.  It could get  
burdensome after a while.

2.  Also, if you dragged a stepping thing into another world, it kept  
ticking in the old world, and if you revisited the old world, then  
back to the new, it got twice the amount of steps desired (it took two  
bugs to create this effect).  This too could become burdensome because  
removal of the morph only decommissioned its stepping behavior from  
the world it was in, not from the other one.

Updating should fix this for you, but if you have some saved worlds  
with spurious stepping scripts, you can now evaluate  
<world>validateScheduler(), and it will remove any stepping action  
whose actor is a morph that is not in that world.  Note that testing  
m.world() is not good enough here, because removal of a morph does not  
necessarily zap the owner pointer;  it is necessary to further test  
that the morphs up the chain are each still actually pointed to by  
their owners.

Enjoy

The crash is related to the value returned from String.fromCharCode(173). In

resembles a minus symbol. I haven't found an ascii table yet which indicates
what this is supposed to represent.

Tracked this down via computeExtents[Config.fontMetricsFromHTML] in
Text.js. I attempted to do some detections on the text node and try/catch

String.fromCharCode = String.fromCharCode.wrap(function(proceed, charCode) {

Actually it might be more cautious to just add special case in
computeExtents (html). But I'm sure you all can figure out what's best.

Phil, this is a great help!

I'll get something out today after I understand it fully.
There seem to be a number of problems with keyboard
commands as well.  Might be related.

Many thanks.

Hey, Workers and Lurkers -

I've just committed Phil's wonderful cure for Webkit (and S4), plus a  
couple of fixes of my own.  The net result is that pretty much the  
entire release runs in Safari 3 and WebKit, and Firefox 3 and  
Minefield, in *both* SVG (index.xhtml) and Canvas (expt.xhtml) modes!   
Of course S3 doesn't show text in canvas, but it still runs.

HELP:  Can some Windoze dudes (or even Windoze emulator dudes) out  
there please check out Google Chrome, in both SVG and Canvas  modes?   
Extra credit for reporting any useful information if it doesn't work  
perfectly (this includes, of course,@all ;-). And super-extra  
credit for sending along fixes for any problems discovered.  It ran  
once (at least in SVG), so we can't be too far off.

My next targets are the hairline repaint errors in Canvas mode, and  
getting the Simple-example-objects world to load properly in Canvas  
mode.  If we can get these done and chrome fixed, then I can feel good  
about releasing it.

	- Dan

PS/HELP:  It could be that this will all run in Opera if we just fix  
up some syntax nits (like comma not allowed after last item in Array  
and Object literals).  I'd be really happy to list Opera among our  
supported browsers if it's not a lot of extra work, and there's  
something to be said for putting our sources into total conformity  
with official JS syntax.

Subject: [General] Introducing Lively for Qt
Message-ID: <49DF253E.5060702@sun.com>
Status: O

Happy Easter,

I'd like to introduce Lively Kernel's sister project,
Lively for Qt:

  http://lively.cs.tut.fi/qt

This is work that we have been doing in collaboration with
the Web Programming Research Team@the Tampere
University of Technology, Finland.

  http://lively.cs.tut.fi

Background:

Qt (http://www.qtsoftware.com/) is a mature, well-documented
cross-platform application development framework and platform
that has been under development since the early 1990s.
Qt supports a rich set of APIs, widgets and tools that
run on most commercial software platforms.  While Qt is
intended primarily for C++ developers, Qt API bindings
are available also for developing applications in JavaScript
and Java.  Interestingly, Qt libraries include a complete
web browser (based on WebKit), as well as a fully functional
JavaScript engine and debugger.

Trolltech, the company developing Qt, was acquired by Nokia
in 2008.  Nokia is currently in the process of making the
Qt APIs available on their mobile phone platforms.
Given Nokia's market share, this will make Qt a very
interesting target platform for mobile applications,
mobile web applications and mashups.

Lively for Qt:

Lively for Qt is a new implementation of the Lively Kernel
in which the "kernel" parts of Lively have been replaced by
functionality offered by Qt.  Lively for Qt inherits most of
the basic functionality (such as the implementation of widgets,
layout management, core event handling and core JavaScript support)
from Qt.  Most of the development work is performed using the APIs
offered by the Qt platform (http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/index.html).
All the existing Qt widgets can be used in applications.
The system can run both natively (e.g., as a desktop/phonetop
environment) as well as in a web browser using a browser plugin.

Since Lively for Qt has been designed to complement Qt, it is
not strictly API-compatible with the Lively Kernel.  However,
the system is definitely compatible in spirit in that it retains
the exceptionally interactive nature (the "liveliness") of the
Lively Kernel, e.g., by allowing the user interface and
application source code to be edited on the fly.  A number of
tools such as a JavaScript code evaluator, object inspector
and a complete JavaScript debugger are included.

Sample applications and mashups:

The students@the Tampere University of Technology
have built various mashup demo applications that run
on top of Lively for Qt.

  http://lively.cs.tut.fi/qt/applications.html

Status:

Like the Lively Kernel, Lively for Qt is a research
artifact that is still under development.  As usual,
we'd be eager to hear your feedback and receive
suggestions (and possible help) for further
development of the system.

Best regards,

-- Antero

Main.js is now calling ide methods evaluateAllButInitializer

How stable is this api? Also, related, the menu commands "add to preamble"
and "add to postscript" no longer seem to do anything. Will there be or is
there now a command in the UI to add a DoitChange?
Robert, I'll probably soon copy my personal worlds from of the wiki - and
maybe put update them later after the wiki is updated. So obviously no rush
on this from me now because most of my worlds might break. :-)

Hi, Phil.

There was an update of the sources in the wiki. However, the wiki  
worlds and the recent changes are not compatible. I wanted to add some  
code which would ensure that the existing worlds would stay compatible  
and would be converted but I hadn't time to get this done. I will not  
be able to do this before next Tuesday.

The new changes scheme is simpler than the old one: There is an  
initializer (simply some JavaScript code) which is run after the world  
is loaded (it is the same as the postscript but exist in any local  
code definition). The preamble does not exist anymore but all  
definitions in the local ChangeSet are loaded before the world is  
recreated.

Robert

I fixed both of these last night and committed the changes.  Turned out all the hairline errors in Canvas mode went away when I coerced the damage rectangles to integer coordinates.  The simple objects world just needed some attention to code rot.

It is sooo nice to have things running solidly in Webkit and Safari 4 (thanks, Phil).  The engine turns about 120 rpm (30 frames/sec) with five cylinders now, in both SVG and Canvas.  It all runs in Firefox and Minefield too, but suffers right now from the considerably slower JavaScript.

It would be really nice if one of you workers or lurkers (or maybe a shirker) could dig in a bit and figure out the problem with Google Chrome.  I don't have access to a machine on which to debug this effectively, but it looks very superficial to me.

With that and a bit of documentation and organization, we can package it all up as an official release.

Will you test Lively running in Chrome <http://www.google.com/chrome> under
Windows?

The two files to test are the normal and canvas versions of latest sources:

   -
   http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/source/kernel/index.xhtml
   -
   http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-kernel/trunk/source/kernel/expt.xhtml

You could begin perhaps by checking out the latest sources, supply empty
files for localconfig.js and Scratch.js, and then see how it runs.

Over the weekend I had access briefly to crudely test in Chrome and mailed
Dan some screenshots. The main issues I saw were 1. examples don't load
because of a few exceptions - a couple of which relate to loading and
parsing of omitted source files 2. text areas (or their clips) display a
black stroke.

For the record, I own a copy of Parallels Desktop and today ordered a copy
of Vista but won't have it setup until the end of the week.

Grazie,
Phil

Yayy, Phil -- Fantastic!

I have made this substitution in the repository for now so that we can easily test on Chrome.  I will replace with a mini version as soon as I can pare it down again in a way that works (we use less than 13k of the full 140k prototype.js).

Regarding Chrome, just about everything seems happy except text borders, and this has been the case all along.  As I test this, it seems that all bordered objects treat borderWidth of 0 as borderWidth 1.  However borderWidth = 0.01 does the right thing, so I will probably put in a Chrome patch for this.

There is also something wrong with Chrome's treatment of gradients in SVG, as you can see the edge of the damage rectangles if you move the mouse over them.

While Chrome does not support text in canvas yet, the text-less display appears to be identical to Safari 3's text-less canvas, so the compatibility omens are good.

It's good to have you with us (Phil just joined the mail list), and MANY thanks for this tip!

Hi Folks -

I just put in a patch to handle the Chrome border bug (at least 
superficially) and it now looks really right.

Hi,

Right after the Chrome patches the page http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/server-install.xhtml 
  started crashing my Safari 4  Public Beta. Other pages still work  
fine (and very fast!).

Unrelated:
In FireFox 3.0.7 on Mac OS X I now get a "no console! console output  
disabled"@every Lively Kernel page. When you click OK the pages do  
load ok.

Thank you all for the great work, highly enjoyable!

Merik

The page load never ends, however. Also never happened before.

Chromium 0.1, the port of Chrome to Mac OS X does display the http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/index.xhtml 
  page,
  but then gives these "failure to Propfind http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/ 
  code 400" errors.
Other pages load and display, then crash Chromium before the full page  
has loaded.
Be aware that Chromium 0.1 is not ready yet, it can only deal with  
'basic' html pages.
I only describe it here because it does indeed already displays and  
work some of the time. And about as fast as Safari 4 Beta.
Drag and drop, resize, moving between worlds, it all works fine.

Hi, Merik -

I reverted the change to miniprototype.js, but that doesn't seem to  
help.  I believe the page is faulty and that the problem (with reading  
it) is not due to recent changes, since I can't read it with a version  
from two months ago.

Thanks
	- Dan

Hi Merik,

Lively has been patched for the likely cause of that Safari 4 crash - but
it's not in the wiki's codebase yet. I reduced font sizes on that page to
help prevent the crash - I'm not seeing the crash you're seeing but it could
be some other cause.

Hi Phil

Ayeee. The broken elevator pitch world was probably me   -didn't realise 
I had broken it, sorry.  I added a pitch, and attempted to save (Safari 
3.2 on Win XP  -saving from the WorldMorph menu) but the page came back 
without my addition and I assumed no save had happened@all (there is 
no wiki widget on that world -and presumably i didn't look@the index 
page to check).

I have@times been unable to load any of your worlds (no errors, but 
they never start) when other worlds were loading fine   -I've had a look 
for errors in the log on these occasions and seen none. Your worlds seem 
to be loading fine@present (on the same machine they have previously 
failed on). I have a hunch that it is related to very slow internet 
connections but that is just a hunch.

regards
Pete F (gerbil)

btw: I'm avoiding putting chrome on my machines (heard disturbing things 
about the license and haven't looked into it), so i can't test there sorry.

btw: No red wine was involved in this, or any other save operation ;-)

The wiki was updated with a recent version of LK. Things should run  
better now, Phil's Safari 4 bugfix is included, there should be less

Hi Dan.  I worked@Webster Research for Xerox ('72-80) hauling PARC  
Altos and tech to our labs.  Our printer software group worked on the  
Multi-Project Chip with a pre-print of the Conway/Mead VLSI book  
building a compressor/decompressor component for the band-based  
(memory striped) printers.  Peter and Alan were very instrumental in  
helping getting ST used@WARC.

Then off to Apple, then Sun, and now retired and out of harms way in  
Santa Fe.  Interestingly enough, Randy Smith (Morphic/Self) was my  
last partner@Sun.

Our (Redfish & the SF Complex) recent Seaside workshop was really  
wonderful, both in the joy of Squeak and seeing how it can be used in  
the web-app world.  Our goal is to build a really distributed Agent  
Based Modeling world -- objects/agents which have geospatial awareness  
and can migrate easily world wide.  Squeak and Javascript looks *very*  
interesting.

Do you have any pointers to how you tamed JS?  Your object style?  It  
looks like the JS world has several object models from "classical" to  
"prototypal".  The LK browser has been very helpful.

One interesting problem we've run into is that almost all the JS  
libraries (Prototype, YUI, jQuery, ..) *presume* a DOM!  Gawd.  But  
then it makes sense, given the history.  I'm a bit surprised@that.   
Prototype, and likely the others, do have a modular design that lets  
you choose good non-DOM subsets from their repositories.

Hi, Dan

Can we put int the MathUuid.js? It solves the duplicated ids problem and 
has a BSD like license, so it is compatible with our MIT license.

UUIDs fixes the problem of wrong clipping rects, that you can see if you 
open any widget in a saved page.

Jens

In the meantime, I've being using this tweak locally. But I haven't delved
into the underlying reason why a separate clipCounter was being used for
clip ids.

lively.scene.Clip.addMethods({
initialize : function(shape) {
this.rawNode = NodeFactory.create('clipPath');
//this.setId(String(this.constructor.clipCounter ++));
this.setId(this.newId());
this.setClipShape(shape);
}
});

Oh, and the cause was that the clip counter always started@zero each time
a world is loaded.

your world documents can exist@the top level of your root directory and
are easier to locate and manage.  This also makes updating from svn much
simpler. You can also keep your localconfig in the root directory while the
defaultconfig resides in the Lively subdirectory.

*Concerns*

These instructions may become obsolete once
"lively.lang.Namespace.defaultBase" begins to reflect a Config setting.
"lively.lang.Namespace.defaultBase" is not available when the Config files
are loaded.

For portability, these instructions use a relative path for Config.codeBase
(below). Haven't delved into the ramifications but it works fine in my
worlds. example.xhtml has a few problems perhaps because some paths are in
subdirectories. "lively.lang.Namespace.defaultBase" is not to easy to modify
because it does not yet exist when the Config files are loaded.  Overall,
something in the kernel or in Namespace.uri() needs to change in the
repository so that the BaseExtension.js patch (below) would not be
necessary. The patch is placed in "your-lib/BaseExtension.js" to make future
updates from svn easier.

Please post to the list if you find improvements to this solution for
tidying the Lively installation. (a weekday is fine :-) ) Please post to the
list if discover and resolve the problems with loading example.xhtml

*Instructions*
*
*
*Make a backup of your Lively directory before continuing.*

Create a new directory named "lively" inside the root kernel directory. Move
the contents of the root kernel directory into "lively".

In each of your world documents, replace:

   - xlink:href="

with:

   - xlink:href="lively/

Next, in each of your world documents, also replace:

   - <script type="text/ecmascript" xlink:href="lively/Base.js"/>

with:

   - <script type="text/ecmascript" xlink:href="lively/Base.js"/>
   <script type="text/ecmascript" xlink:href="your-libs/BaseExtension.js"/>

*your-libs/BaseExtension.js*

Config.codeBase = '/lively/';
lively.lang.Namespace.prototype.uri =
lively.lang.Namespace.prototype.uri.wrap(function(proceed) {
lively.lang.Namespace.defaultBase = Config.codeBase;
var result = proceed();
 return result;
});

Config.codeBase is now defined and used consistently. In order to run  
LK from a subdirectory you just have to set this property.

Some folks prefer to access email lists this way rather than mail.  It has a

It also makes it a lot easier to search than the Mailman archives.

Message-ID: <A7097794-4CF4-4D0C-9971-2DD8B8200A33@backspaces.net>
Status: O

OK, now for the dumb question of the month: How in the world does LK  
wrestle JS into being a message based, OO system?

I'm reading "Object-Oriented JavaScript" by Stoyan Stefanov and it  
takes me back to the days that Lisp and Scheme declared that they  
simply didn't need OO architectures, they can invent their own so  
easily it was not important.  They forgot to mention that they needed  
the rest of the world to agree with which ever system they chose! ..  
few of the alternatives interoperate!

So the book points out about a dozen ways to be OO in JS.  I know LK  
uses Prototype.  Is that the Answer?  Or did LK figure out a sane  
system that fits the Smalltalk messaging model well that isn't in the  
several JS OO patterns?

Whew!

Status: O

Javascript is a message-oriented OO system except that it doesn't support
classes per se -
prototypes<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming>
instead.
The LIvely team added class support with the function "subclass" which is
defined in Base.js. I'm sure the team will answer this completely - I can't
answer the Smalltalk analogy.
TextMorph.subclass('mynamespace.MyTextMorph', {
 initialize : function($super) {
 $super(new Rectangle(0, 0, 200, 30), 'Some Text');
}
});

For a comparison, this is plain Javascript - and this is the most common way
to create objects to message.
Person = function() {
 this.initialize();
};

Person.prototype = {
 initialize : function() {
console.log('Person.initialize');
},
 sayHello : function() {
console.log('Hello');
}
};

var person = new Person();
person.sayHello();

Hi all -

For those of you running with the latest sources in the repository, I  
want to warn you that I have just made significant changes to the text  
composition logic.  I am doing this to prepare for local recomposition  
of edits, which should mean we can edit reasonably large files in LK.

In the process I have fixed the problem of not being able to edit  
lines that were broken without spaces.

I have also discovered that most text gets composed three times before  
being displayed.  I may or may not fix this before introducing the  
local edit logic, but I will definitely look into it before I'm done.

WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP:

	* Please let me know of anything that fails now that worked before  
today.

	* Please let me know of anything else that needs to be fixed in LK text

Thanks

	- Dan

Hi, Dan.

When there is more than one line in a TextMorph and you move the  
cursor to the end of the last line and press <UP> the cursor will not  
jump to the line before that.

When you select text with with <SHIFT> and <DOWN> the last line will  
not be selected.

When you press <ENTER> the cursor is moved to the very end of the  
current line, it is moved to the next line after typing one character.

Sometimes the cursor disappears when@the end of text. I currently  
do not know how to reproduce that behavior.

Weird existing behavior: when inserting
newlines into TextWindows/TextMorphs using the enter key, the insertion
point is usually always aligned right and not aligned left.

It's really awesome that you're working in Text.js Dan because it is so
important. But yeah: shapes are more cool.

Grazie,

Message-ID: <ad622aba0904221727n3333bf3md85f3750afce1d20@mail.gmail.com>
Status: O

What's the proper way to affect/construct padding or margins for Morphs?
I've never really wrangled it and have just been using a separate margin
insets property in the morphs I use for layout.
I'm accustomed to using Insets from Swing. In Lively, it looks like I need
to be using Rectangle.insetBy or Rectangle.expandBy.

If I simply assign a Rectangle as padding - e.g. new Rectangle(0, 50, 0, 0)
- that adds 50 pixels of padding to the top *and* to the bottom (TextMorph).
Is this the proper behavior?

I am currently investigating this - but still want to ask.

Thanks,
Phil

Hi, i do not understand why still uses Object.extend, can't those
properties be defined within the "subclass" construct?
Thanks in advance!

Gradient.subclass("LinearGradient", {

    initialize: function($super, stopColor1, stopColor2, vector) {

        this.rawNode = NodeFactory.create("linearGradient",

        this.addStop(0, stopColor1).addStop(1, stopColor2);

Hi, Haowei.

Those properties and functions defined in the subclass construct are  
defined for instances of the class, i.e. they are added to the  
prototype property of a class. Object.extend, however, adds functions  
and properties directly to the given object, not its prototype property.

Message-ID: <3F74AA83-ACDA-4383-A919-C9B1D292BCA5@Sun.com>
Status: O

Folks -

I've just put out a new version of Text.js (with minor changes to  
Widgets.js, and CanvasExpt.js).  I've tested it quite a bit and feel  
it's ready to go out, but we should all be ready to revert if  
something is amiss.  I did *not* rewrite the kernel of text, which  
should be done some day.

The main things I did are...
Reused the structures (lines and "chunks") before and after the  
replacement when typing.  It's a lot better in big texts, but still a  
bit slow.  Some of the problem is clearly SVG thrashing around which  
can't be helped.  [Some day we should bundle characters when things  
get behind.  I opted not to do that this time, because the logic is  
almost all in event queuing]

Avoided one or two of the redundant composition passes for, eg, text  
in lists.

Fixed the bug that made it impossible to select in a line that was  
forced to wrap.

Pulled a few more classes in to the lively.Text namespace.

Fixed a bug with use of the UP key when cursor was on last line.

Made canvas LK only redraw the lines actually in the damage region.

Please test this, and let me know of any problems.  I will be  
traveling for the next couple of days, so if there are significant  
problems, we should revert until I can dig deep.  Also, let's test the  
ability to read old worlds (one of the big reasons I didn't redo the  
whole kernel) before we promote this code into the wiki.

Enjoy

No, LK has nor real support for multiple inheritance, however, you can  
simply copy functions and properties from one class to another (note  
that $super, instanceof, etc. will not work correctly). LK uses this  
for Trait-like constructs. E.g. look@NetRequestReporterTrait in  
Network.js and it where it is used.

Object.subclass('ClassA', {
	m1: function() { return 1},
	m2: function() { return 2},
});
Object.subclass('ClassB', {
	m2: function() { return 22 },
	m3: function() { return 3 }
});
ClassA.subclass('ClassC', ClassB.prototype);

x = new ClassC();
x.m1() // 1
x.m2() // 22
x.m3() // 3
x instanceof ClassA // true
x instanceof ClassB // false

Haowei wrote this question to me off list, but I figure the answer may  
be of interest to a number of folks out there...

> may i ask what sort of IDE or editor do you use for Lively Kernel  
> development?

I use the System Browser of the Lively Kernel itself exclusively now.   
You can open this from the world menu Tools item to check it out.  It  
is mostly the work of Robert Krahn.

The System Browser starts by showing you a list of all the files in  
the source repository.  If you click on one, it will parse it (using  
the Lively Kernel's own JavaScript parser built using OMeta), and then  
display it in a Smalltalk-style class/method presentation.  When you  
make changes, the files are appropriately updated [Note that you will  
not be able to make changes to the files until you run it from a copy  
of our repository].  You can also turn eval on, and it will cause  
changes that you make to take immediate effect in the system you are  
using.

When I work on something that is not@the core of the system (like  
the kaleidoscope), then I turn eval on, and there is no delay from  
accepting changes to the time they take effect.

Over the past week I rewrote a lot of the text code which would have  
been bad with eval on.  This is because if you make a mistake, you not  
only crash your system, but the changes are on file so you have to un- 
make them before you can get back to work.  In this case, I run two  
browser windows, one with the LK System Browser in it (the IDE), and  
the other with a test system running.  I make some changes in the IDE  
window (or tab), and then reload the test window.  If it has bugs I go  
back and fix them in the first window.  This is classical cross- 
debugging, but the time between cycles is only a few seconds, because  
I specify

	Config.skipMostExamples = true; // suppress examples that are slow (*)

in my localconfig file, so that a reload only takes 3 or 4 seconds.   
Each time I get to a point where the test system seems solid, then I  
reload the IDE window so that I am living with the changes for a bit  
of extra testing.  When things seem really solid, then I commit the  
changes to the SVN repository, a one-line command that only takes a  
few seconds.

(*) PS:  There is a way to specify such changes with a URL flag, but I  
always forget it.  Robert or Krzysztof, if this is in the Wiki can you  
say where and, if it is not, could you put a brief description along  
with a list of some of the more useful ones (many can be learned from  
a reading of defaultconfig.js

Collapsed windows in a world do not stay collapsed when you leave the  
world and come back to it.

Reframing text (simple, not in a window) does not recompose the text  
until you stop reframing.  I'm sure this is my problem.

The simple example morphs world does not load from serialized.  I've  
temporarily set the flag so that they will be created from JavaScript,

Hi Haowei -

Yes.  I have been pushing to augment our current "extends" construct  
with a message category name, so that the browser can give a bit more  
help in the case of major classes.  I believe this would be the place  
to add a public/private distinction as well.

It's true that without a type system it is harder to guarantee proper  
behavior, but in my view 90% of the value is in highlighting the  
public protocol so the system is more understandable, and authors are  
motivated to make it so.

The fact is that with our cool method-wrapping metasystem (that we use  
for profiling of various sorts) it would be easy (truly only a couple  
of lines of code!) to implement a test mode in which the system ran  
with dynamic checks for violation of private access.  This is not a  
guarantee of conformance, but  it would catch violations in any code  
that actually ran.  I think we'd be very happy with the result.

Thanks for your interest

I'm just getting my head around JS fine points, so this could be way  
off!  But I believe for private method/class variables, you'd use a  
closure during the object construction (new).

This closure would have "var" variables, in addition to the "this"  
variables.  These variables would only be visible to methods, and  
could not be retrieved directly via the dot notation.

Whew!

You have this exactly right. JavaScript has only one working
encapsulation mechanism. This pattern of using it for defining
encapsulated objects is due to Doug Crockford (cc'ed) and is known as
the "objects as closures" pattern.

Actually, in the objects as closure pattern, "this" and "new" are both
useless. ("new"@least is also harmless. Not so for "this".) For
example:

  function Point(x, y) {
    var magnitude = Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);
    var self = {
      getX: function(){ return x; },
      getY: function(){ return y; },
      getSize: function(){ return magnitude; },
      toString: function() {
        return '<' + self.getX() + ',' + self.getY() + '>';
      }
    }

Such an object is just a record of methods, each of which is a closure
defined in the object's construction context. The captured lexical
variables from that construction context are the object's instance
variables (x, y, magnitude, self). As Dan will remember, this view of
objects hearkens back to some of the early thinking around
Smalltalk-72 and Actors (though Smalltalk-72 had dynamic scoping).
Further elaborations of this pattern (See the Cajita examples in
<http://google-caja.googlecode.com/files/caja-spec-2008-06-07.pdf>)
can accommodate inheritance, and, on Caja and the upcoming EcmaScript
5, can make these objects tamper proof (via freezing). The
objects-as-closure pattern will also be the basis for the class system
of EcmaScript Harmony (which is likely to become EcmaScript 6).

The problem with this pattern today is that is costs one allocation
per method per instance. In previous conversations with Lively Kernel
folks, this cost was felt to be a show stopper for use of this pattern
in LK. AFAIK, no other workable technique for encapsulation has yet
been discovered for JavaScript.

We are still working our way up to a proper release.  The Lively 
Kernel itself seems pretty well ready@this point, as it now runs 
reasonably on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome in both SVG and Canvas 
variants (at least in the Beta versions that offer Canvas).

It would be nice to be able to add Canvas and SVG variants of Opera 
and Internet Explorer.

I believe that Opera only fails due to a few runtime issues and a few 
syntax issues that should be fairly easy to clear up.  It's a nice 
platform in that it supports both Canvas and SVG already, and it runs 
on a number of mobile devices.

Internet Explorer is another matter.  There is a plugin to supply SVG 
for IE (see http://www.examotion.com/), and I believe there are a 
couple of packages that will support most canvas operations in IE by 
using VML (see...
	http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2008/08/mozilla-drags-ie-into-the-future-with-canvas-element-plugin.ars
	http://blogs.msdn.com/sompost/archive/2006/02/22/536967.aspx
).  I believe that the main hurdle for IE is their JavaScript which 
has several incompatibilities with our code.  What I don't know is 
how serious theres are and/or what is needed to run al alternative JS 
in its place.  What I read looks pretty daunting.  The best solution 
for IE may be for us to complete a Java applet that runs LK, and then 
folks can (hopefully) start this up in IE.  But that won't happen in 
time for the release.

Anyone want to earn a silver star by getting Opera to run Lively 
Kernel?  Partial credit will also be awarded for making enough 
progress to be clear about what more is needed.

I dabbled testing in Opera a bit and these are some notes in case any other
Lively users can also debug in Opera...

   - Opera does not support console.log but instead
   supports: opera.postError (http://dev.opera.com/forums/topic/231622)
      - opera.postError will hopefully help with debugging
   - first: document.baseURI needs to be changed to document.documentURI
   - undefined values are occasionally being passed to Base.js:rect()
   function
   - so probably need to tweak defaultconfig.js inside localconfig.js to
   load portions of the examples just a bit@a time

LIvely SVG does load and run in Opera <http://www.opera.com/browser/>. The
morph menu works. :-) These are some starting points if you will continue to
test in Opera <http://www.opera.com/browser/>.

   - document.baseURI needs to be changed to document.documentURI

Opera has a significant problem with polygons and SVGPointList.
When points is set inside lively.scene.Polygon.setVertices(), numberOfItems
always remains@zero.

I've tried a couple of things but no luck yet. I've tried calling
consolidate on the SVGPointList after points get set. But I don't know
what consolidate does actually. ;-) And I've tried instead using
points.appendItem(svgPoint). No luck there yet.

this.rawNode.points.consolidate();
var svgPoint = new SVGPoint(p.x, p.y);
this.rawNode.points.appendItem(svgPoint);

(All of this is with document.documentURI fixed, skipMostExamples:
true, skipAllExamples: true)

Also, this is how to disable caching in Opera.
http://blog.rsstab.com/2008/08/how-to-disable-page-caching-in-opera-browser/
Doesn't seem to work - but that's how you do it.

Yea! Progress with the polygons. Clock hands now working, star working,
polygons working. The underlying problem it seems was that SVGPointList had
existing points in a namespace of "NS1" (???)
In lively.scene.Polygon.setVertices

   - changed: this.rawNode.setAttributeNS(null, "points", attr);
   - to: this.rawNode.setAttribute("points", attr);

Sample code for lively.scene.Polygon.setVertices

    setVertices: function(vertlist) {
if (this.rawNode.points) {
    this.rawNode.points.clear();
}
if (this.useDOM) {
vertlist.forEach(function(p) { this.rawNode.points.appendItem(p) }, this);
} else {
var attr = vertlist.map(function(p) {
return (p.x||0.0) + "," + (p.y||0.0)
}).join(' ');

this.rawNode.setAttribute("points", attr);
if (true) {
var result = new XMLSerializer().serializeToString(this.rawNode);
console.log('this.rawNode:' + result);
}
}
    },

This gets most of the examples up and running in Opera.

find and replace: document.baseURI to document.documentURI
in lively.scene.Polygon.setVertices, change
setAttributeNS(null, "points"
setAttribute("points";
in defaultconfig, change (because throws SVGException
SVG_MATRIX_NOT_INVERTABLE)
showEngine: function() { return false},
Also helpful to use opera.postError somewhere in Core.js:log() - but I did
it as sort of a hack. These aren't total solutions - just the factors so
far.

Update. Missed listing one step I mentioned previously. So here are the
steps again.
*index.xhtml*
<body style="margin:0px;height:700px;">
<svg id="canvas" width="100%" height="100%"

everywhere
find and replace
document.baseURI to document.documentURI

lively.scene.Polygon.setVertices
change
setAttributeNS(null, "points"
to
setAttribute("points";

defaultconfig.js, change (because throws SVGException
SVG_MATRIX_NOT_INVERTABLE)
showEngine: function() { return false},
Also helpful to use opera.postError somewhere in Core.js:log() - but I did
it as sort of a hack. These aren't total solutions - just the factors so

Some things I noticed. Piano keyboard does not open. Kaleidoscope may not be
working fully. Keyboard arrows not working in CanvasScape. Grid lyaout demo
is bunched together.

Many thanks, Phil!  We'll merge these in asap.  I feel good about  
Opera being one of our supporters (or is it vice-versa? ;-).

I'll check these out.  Grid layout is a work in progress, and the  
kaleidoscope is an acid test (I couldn't believe when it "just worked"  
in Canvas mode).

Thanks again

Hi, Phil -

Thank you for figuring this out. I added your changes to the code base.

Dan,

I've been away from LK lately, but I'm starting to get back into it,
and I was wondering whether you've made any progress with the
downward-propagating transformations thing that you mentioned a year
ago. (See below.) The smarter ticking strategy helped, but it'd be
nice if I could just know when the line's endpoint has moved. :)

Dynamic Languages Symposium 2009

October 26, 2009

Co-located with OOPSLA 2009
Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN
Disney's Contemporary Resort, Orlando, Florida

http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/swa/dls/dls-09/

***** Call for papers *****

The 5th Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS)@OOPSLA 2009 is a forum  
for discussion of dynamic languages, their implementation and  
application. While mature dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp,  
Scheme, Self, Prolog, and APL continue to grow and inspire new  
converts, a new generation of dynamic scripting languages such as  
Python, Ruby, PHP, Tcl, and JavaScript are successful in a wide range  
of applications. DLS provides a place for researchers and  
practitioners to come together and share their knowledge, experience,  
and ideas for future research and development.

DLS 2009 invites high quality papers reporting original research,  
innovative contributions or experience related to dynamic languages,  
their implementation and application. Accepted Papers will be  
published in the ACM Digital Library.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

* Innovative language features and implementation techniques
* Development and platform support, tools
* Interesting applications
* Domain-oriented programming
* Very late binding, dynamic composition, and runtime adaptation
* Reflection and meta-programming
* Software evolution
* Language symbiosis and multi-paradigm languages
* Dynamic optimization
* Hardware support
* Experience reports and case studies
* Educational approaches and perspectives
* Object-oriented, aspect-oriented, and context-oriented programming

=== Submissions and proceedings ===

We invite original contributions that neither have been published  
previously nor are under review by other refereed events or  
publications. Research papers should describe work that advances the  
current state of the art. Experience papers should be of broad  
interest and should describe insights gained from substantive  
practical applications. The program committee will evaluate each  
contributed paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and  
originality.

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

Papers are to be submitted electronically@http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dls2009 
  in PDF format. Submissions must not exceed 12 pages and need to use  
the ACM format, templates for which can be found@http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html 
.

=== Important dates ===

Submission of papers: June 1, 2009 (hard deadline)
Author notification: July 13, 2009
Final versions due: August 4, 2009
DLS 2009: October 26
OOPSLA 2009: October 25-29

Subject: [General] A Few Questions
Message-ID: <8dd95f390908032105u66d02eb6l47cea1ee8bec34a1@mail.gmail.com>
Status: O

Greetings All,
By your leave,  I have a few basic questions I'd like to ask:

1. I downloaded a package called lively-fx.12.02.08 from your downloads
page. I don't understand anything about how subversion works, so maybe I did
something wrong. As far as I can understand this is a webpage. I should be
able to drag index.xhtml to a browser icon from the folder on the desktop
and get the same result as the Start The Very Latest Version link on the
homepage. Or I could double click index.html, click "here" and see the gui.
Am I confused about that? You'd deploy this in the server the same way as
any index.html file. You'd just ensure all the <def></def> files in the
<svg></svg> were immediately available. No?

2. What are these ".jar" files for? Those are Java binaries, I'm guessing,
and this is an all JavaScript project. Isn't it?

3. You used classical inheritance with subclass() and extend() to implement
Morphic, right? That means you're bringing Morphic to SVG is from Squeak and
not from Self. Is that correct? For some reason I thought I'd see the true
way to use prototypical inheritance in Lively Kernel, as I had it in my mind
that Self + JavaScript = Lively Kernel.

The Google Talks video was very useful.

4. Douglas Crockford has had an influence on how people use JavaScript.
Learning about Self I see that the versatility of that language comes@a
price. It's simple code. And I like the wholeness of it enough to explore it
further, but it seems to use a smaller unit of composition than the class.
The slot is a sort of mobile method, it seems to me. My point is that I
think people find this language a bit confusing, Self and JS both, because
the unit of construction, the granularity of the language, is much smaller
than people are used to. They implement classical inheritance everywhere to
use a larger unit of construction, I think. What have you taken from Mr.
Crockford's use of JavaScript, and why didn't you use prototypical
inheritance in the JavaScript?

5. How did you develop this? I mean, I'd like to have some Self or Squeak
browsers or tools to manage JavaScript. As you can tell, I'm very interested
in prototypical inheritance. It would be nice, when using JavaScript, to
have a browser window to see a chain from top to bottom. Did you use such a
tool? I can't see writing Core.js, which prints out to 124- pages, as one
file you worked on in vi or BBEdit. You must have had some kind of IDE.
Firebug is great, but it couldn't be so useful. .. could it?

I'd like to say now that there are probably several material
misunderstandings in the questions I've asked, and I apologize for mistaking
things that are perhaps obvious to some. But as I said to Elliot Miranda on
his blog: "Well, if you're here..."

Chris,

I can't answer the Lively-Kernel-specific questions, but I've got a
couple of thoughts about the more general prototype-based-system ones.
(We could take this discussion over to
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/self-interest/ if it's not appropriate
here.)

Even in Self, we use a class-like pattern a lot of the time (see
http://selflanguage.org/documentation/published/organizing-programs.html).
I'm not very familiar with the Lively Kernel code base, but it doesn't
surprise me that it uses a lot of classes. And if I glance through LK,
it looks to me like there are a few objects that aren't class
instances, which is about what I'd expect.

The way I usually think about it, classes are a fine idea; it's just
the idea that "every object is an instance of a class" that causes
trouble. The value of prototypes isn't that you suddenly organize your
entire code base in this whole new completely-different way; it's that
the core of the system becomes simpler and more flexible and easier to
learn. That flexibility lets you use some fun new organizational
patterns, but the good old "class" pattern is still an important one.

I'm not quite sure what you mean. Self's module system uses slot-level
granularity because when you're loading a module into the image it's
useful to be able to add stuff to existing objects. That's certainly
not unique to prototype-based systems - for example, open up a Squeak
image and look for method categories with an asterisk in front of
their names. (That's the mechanism that Squeak uses to indicate that
the methods in that category should belong to a different module than
the one the class belongs to.) Lively Kernel seems to be doing
something similar - occasionally using Object.extend to add slots to
existing objects.

Status: O

Lively Folks -

The last few months have been somewhat of a distraction from the 
original goals of the Lively Kernel project, but I'm happy to report 
both progress in spite of distraction, and some vision for the future.

First of all, with regard to progress we have just put out a new 
release, version 0.9.  Check it out at...

	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/index.xhtml


Notable steps forward in 0.9:

Better support for gradients
	compare the new clock and engine

Reasonable compatibility across platforms
	Safari, FireFox, Chrome, latest versions
	See more below regarding Opera and IE

Nearly complete operability using Canvas in place of SVG
	Try it out at...
	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/expt.xhtml
	Here Lively manages damage rectangles and
	redisplay entirely in JavaScript.  Execute...
	  WorldMorph.current().showDamageRectangles = true
	... to see it in action.  This runs in all the above browsers.

Wiki
	The Lively Kernel now includes a fairly complete client-side Wiki.
	In other words, worlds c an be saved via WebDAV into an SVN repository
	thus allowing one-click save as well as revert to previous versions.
	This together with a ChangeSet-style workspace offers
	much of the Smalltalk-image style of project development.
	[Requires some setup for the repository]

Media player
	The new VideoMorph allows embedding of players such as
	YouTube and Vimeo in Lively Kernel worlds.  There's an example
	in the sample widgets world.  Can be used to get just sound, too.
	[seems only to work in Safari;  Let us know if you can fix for others]

HTML
	We now have a way to embed (multiple) Lively Kernel worlds
	in normal HTML, thus opening the possibility of LK
	serving as an entire Dojo-like widget and viewing frameworlk
	Try, for example...
	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/divChallenge.html

MIT Open Source Licensing
	The Lively Kernel has been relicensed under an MIT-style license
	for some time now on the developer's repository, but we're happy
	now to have these on the main site.


You can participate...

Projects
We are in the process of working out how to sign people up for our 
Wiki.  Once that works, it is a great way to show off cool stuff and 
publish useful tools as well.  Even better, if you would like to host 
a Lively project wiki, write to us or to this list, and we'll tell 
you what's involved.

Opera
Not long ago, we had everything working in Opera, but that seems to 
have regressed.  Anyone care to track down the problem and submit a 
fix?

Mystery
We (mostly Robert so far) are working on a project called Chameleon. 
We hope to share it very soon and get others involved.

O3D
Have you noticed the O3D plugin that bundles V8 and 2D and 3D 
renderer?  It shouldn't be hard to port the Canvas version to run in 
2D with that plugin, providing possibly interesting performance as 
well as a solution for Internet Explorer and any other browsers that 
don't support the Lively Kernel.  If you get it working before we do, 
you get a bottle of champagne.

Visualization
We are getting interested in data visualization.  If you take Jens 
Linke's Fabrik-like kit visual programming tool, and add a few basic 
data views, the Lively kernel starts to be a pretty useful way to 
look@data all over the Internet, whether scraped from the screen 
or slurped from databases.  And now with the HTML bridge established, 
it can all be integrated with mainstream web sites.  Build a new 
view.  Build a surprising HTML page.  Play with Fabrik.


Have fun, and don't forget to write!

	- Dan

I am more in favor of the opposite extreme - using Lively to display XML or
HTML document content without CSS per se - instead using Lively stylesheets
or handlers. For the Lively wiki to be more usable for documentation and
such Lively needs enhancements in the area of layout managers and flowing
connected page layouts within vertically scrollable worlds - like a typical
web page. Just want to mention this as being highly desirable to me but I
know it's a pretty significant effort. Markup language support within Lively
though is not as important though as page and section layout management in
general in Lively - in my opinion. In a nutshell, Lively needs page layout
support like Apple Pages or Adobe Pagemaker would provide. Priority: I'd say
below wiki functionality but above visualizations and 3D support.

See the comments on this article for more info and reasoning. Some of the
comments attached to this article describe the separation of rendering
engines from the browser:

Subject: [General] a peculiar lively interview
Message-ID: <4AEAFE2D.8060402@spatialmedia.com>
Status: O

It was great to see an update on LK last week, because a news vacuum 
tends to get filled by all kinds of nonsense. For example; I don't know 
what to make of this interview (transcript follows). The interviewer, 
who seems to be mad, insists on calling his guest Dan, but he is clearly 
not talking to Dan Ingalls.

The frustrating thing, is that every time it looks like they are going 
to discuss anything interesting (liveliness on the 3D web, the parallel 
'revolution', ajax & IE prognosis) , somehow they don't.

Frankly, I'm starting to wonder if it is some kind of hoax. 

Pete F  (gerbil)


[Transcript of  "The Pod People Show".  Episode 7201 follows..]

PP. [sponsor's messages deleted] And today we have Dan Pringles on the 
line. So Dan  -I hear that in the 70s you just hung out@the park 
working on your Kung Fu moves, till you invented the BlackBelt..
Dan: Ummm -are you talking about bitblt? Do you have me confused 
with[interupted]

PP: Blipblip -right. That's what I said. So Dan, have you ever had to 
kill a man with your hands?

Dan: Not yet.

PP: Damm! So now you're working with this Lively Colonel dude -who is 
he? I bet he kicks butt.

Dan: Well its certainly been exciting. The Lively Kernel is our attempt 
to implement a general computing platform in a web browser.

PP: A General?  I thought he was a Colonel? So he like busted out of an 
enemy POW camp,  kicked an incredible amount of butt and got promoted?  
Hooo-ahh!

Dan: Its just a web page. Try googling for lively kernel.

PP: Oh right, sure. google lively.

Dan: No, Google Lively was something else..

PP: But you just told me, google lively. Ah you playing with my head? 
Ohhh right! Some kind of ninja mind control thing? Wax on wax off?

Dan: Google Lively is a lively world that seems to be dead   -we are 
doing something else.

PP: Well i bet they were pissed you stole their name

Dan: Well actually, Google announced lively well after the lively kernel 
was released.

PP: The Colonel was released? I thought he escaped.

Dan: Never mind. Perhaps I should talk a bit about our take on lively 
world's like Second Life. After all, an always running environment, 
which is engaging and concrete, and sufficiently lively to get 
non-programmers programming   -is very much what we have been always had 
in mind. So you might be surprised that we have chosen to work on 
livliness on the 2D web. Perhaps I could talk about our take on 3D 
liveliness ,  the "3D web", and also our anticipation of 3D support in 
browsers.

PP: Well you could Dan, but I see that we have some questions from our 
forum. Jason asks: "are you guys even serious  -what kind of ajax 
doesn't run on IE?"

Dan: Well we don't really think of Lively Kernel as an ajax framework. 
If we were feeling devilish we might even say something like "if ajax 
wants to grow up from some cunning shims and hacks, to a real platform  
-well the kind of generality that lively is all about, is what it takes  
-and if that means letting go of IE or using plugins, well....". 

    [laughs] Actually -we've actually been doing some experiments with 
IE, and have concluded that [interupted]..

PP: Now can I just jump in here Dan  -I think I can take this one for 
you. So Ajax  -that's the dude's name then? That name rocks!   Well 
Jason, I can tell you that Colonel Ajax does't *run* anywhere. He stands 
and fights. Lock and load soldier.

Dan: Perhaps Jason would be interested in our RIA work on Java -and our 
decision to not use Batik, especially in light of our move away from SVG 
towards Canvas on browsers.

A. Did you catch that Jason? Colonel Ajax is MIA in Java, raining down 
RPG fire on enemy canvas. Fire in the hole. There's boageys inside the 
wire!

Dan: That's not quite what I said.

PP. I've got your back Dan. Plausible deniability. Here's Jason again  
-and it sounds like Jason likes the MIA thing cause he says here; "great 
-it has always seemed to me that Lively's timing is off  -Java and 
Silverlight seem to offer far more scope for building a serious platform 
than ajax. Why bother with browsers@at all when the RIA platforms are 
running away with the richest interactive content".

Dammit Jason, what is it with you and running away?

Dan: Well you know its funny. You can talk about ajax vs ria  -but you 
can also just talk about simplicity and generality. The net neutrality 
people like to say "fat pipes, always on  -get out of the way"  We might 
say "fast javascript, good graphics   -get out of the way". The 
difference between RIA and browsers is less important that way. On the 
other hand, if Jason could see the lengths we go to just to fake looking 
at the stack, he might reasonably ask why we don't just dust off jsqueak

A  Personally you had me@"get out of the way" Dan, but can i just ask 
one more cause I'm excited....The revolution Dan  -it's just around the 
corner isn't it? No more laws anymore!

Dan: No Moore's law anymore? Well, that's not actually correct. Moore's 
law still holds, but the hardware guys seem to have run out of ideas 
about what to do with those transistors.

PP: I'm talkin impending revolution here Dan. You know that bit in War 
of the Worlds, when the aliens have landed in the park  -and everyone 
knows  -but they just keep on acting like nothing has changed? Just 
living their lives, doing the same thing..

Dan: ..and writing the same old sequential, state mutating, code 
right?   Well, I guess you are really asking a bunch of questions here; 
How can the computer help people think about concurrency? Can OO really 
do parallelism or do we all need to go learn Erlang or Haskell?  Can 
javascript the language ever handle more than one thread? Will web 
browsers support parallelism and what will it look like? How far can 
this idea of a mashup take us down the concurrency road?

 Well, [chuckles] we have actually given some thought to this  stuff, 
and we think that [audio drops out here]

PP: Sorry, you're breaking up a little there Dan -I think you were 
saying that when the revolution comes you'll be dining with the 
philosophers -and may I say that's mighty heroic of you, throwing down 
your life like that for the cause.

Dan: Sorry?

PP: It'll be you, me, and the Colonel@that table Dan.

Dan: Err, well it's looking like there is going to be a lot of room@
the table.

PP: A lot of room Dan. Might be hard to find enough philosphers.

Dan: I guess that's one way to state the parallelism problem.  Mind you  
-that does mean less conflict over chopsticks to resolve.

PP.:You're speaking my language Dan. Too many soldiers have died face 
down in the mud, resolving conflicts over chopsticks

Dan: I think that is overstating it, but shared state concurrency is 
hard. People seem to find actors easier to comprehend

PP:  Well certainly not that Marlon Brando in Apocalypse-Now, Dan -I 
couldn't work out a damm word the man was saying. Kickass movie though.

Dan: Err.. hey  -sure!

PP: Well thanks for coming on the show Dan.   I've been talking to Dan 
Pringles about Colonel Lively.   Next week we have child actor turned IP 
attorney, Danny Kay. Danny will be talking to us about his new book "the 
best way to prevent the future is to patent it". Stay tuned for some 
messages from our sponsor [deleted]

about the thinking around LK, something happens.

Hi folks,

So far I could not have contributed the Lively Kernel project@all,
but I really want to see Lively Kernel version of the Croquet [0]
implementation. The web browsers are going to support Web Sockets [1],
WebGL [2], etc., there seems to be no reason that the Lively Kernel
cannot move even forward, and if there is anything that blocks the

Thanks for taking a step!

I think there's another item which is a punch list of things that 
need to be done, and a road map or wish list of things that should be 
done or would be fun@least.  Maybe refactor these as a roadmap 
under evangelism, and one more project descriptions designed to get 
people interested and hopefully induce some actual participation.

	4.  Projects

I'm willing to take a first pass@the content for evangelism.  I 
will try to get something out very soon (next day or two) because I 
have another deadline looming that will keep me busy until the end of 
the month.  It would be great if someone else could then pretty it up 
and disseminate it along the lines of Phil's earlier message.

I have two thoughts about ways to generate interest and possibly even funding:


Interest:
I was going to do this last year but I ran out of time.  Sadly the 
timing is really tight again, but...
The idea is to do an Advent Calendar in Lively Kernel.  This was done 
once in Squeak and it was a *lot* of fun.  The idea is that there is 
a front page with 25 places you can click, but you can only look@
the first N of them on December Nth.  It has the following virtues...

	It's a time when people are looking for distraction
	It's a seasonal topic so easy to "advertise"
	It's an opportunity for lots of simple cute hacks
	It can easily be a tutorial in disguise

Obviously it would be nice to have all the punch list items done 
first, but I think a better strategy@this point is to build some 
momentum and then use the community to do some of the finish work 
(this is why the roadmap is important).  My experience from last year 
is that this is best done in the Lively Wiki.


Funding / incentive
I listen to people groaning about how to become an iPhone developer 
and how to break into the iPhone app marketing engine, and yet Lively 
Kernel apps run just fine in the iPhone with no need for Flash and no 
interference from Apple.

What if,@the end of the Advent Calendar, there were a way to join 
an LK Wiki and be able to save your fun hacks and useful apps that 
could run on iPhone (and others).  If we could pull off the calendar 
project, we could rally a lot of attention.


I'll try to put together some text for a WikiPedia page and roadmap 
in the next day or two, and maybe people can discuss some more in the 
meantime.

If I were King of Lively, I might decide to leave popularity to the 
politicians, and remain focussed on my quest for the grail.

Either way, I would banish all evangelists from my Kingdom. There is too 
much evangelism in the world, and not enough pastoralism.

To be popular
-------------
Being a popular King, means having to have a good answer to a question 
like: "our school only uses IE and Flash, and even if we installed a 
supported browser, Lively feels sluggish and the kids find it fiddly to 
use"   -which isn't even a question.

"Where is the debugger" is a question; but isn't any easier to answer.

Yes, I am saying that Lively isn't ready for the prime-time. Lively 
doesn't have to be *quite* as crisp to use as a trinket implemented in 
Flash, but it has to be closer. Lively doesn't have to offer all the 
bells and whistles of a Visual Studio, Dreamweaver or Squeak  -but it 
has to be closer than it is now.

There are lots of interesting possibilities for getting there quickly I 
think, but they amount to the usual Kingly strategy:  LIE ,CHEAT,  STEAL 
AND KILL.

I'll post details on each over the next couple of days, as I get a 
chance to trim my ramblings down a little.

Status: O

Short version:

IMO, the *Java* version of Lively is the fast route to a universal, 
fast, tight platform. Such a platform  is a prerequisite for an active 
community.

Where has the Java work got to? 


Rambling version:  

Did I really say "Lively isn't ready for the prime time"?  I immediately 
regretted pushing send. It is close and beautiful, and packs more power 
into the browser than anything else  -but the prime time is unforgiving 
and insists that if you are going to play the browser game, you have to 
play it well. This means supporting four browsers on all the platforms 
those browser run on. Lively could do it, (though it's thankless task 
that never ends) but doesn't do four browsers now. And (yawn yawn) we 
need more speed, and can't rely on Moore's Law.


So...

To me, the way forward is obvious: Focus on the Java implementation, 
doing whatever it takes (meaning writing tactical Java) to make Lively 
as slick, responsive and consistent as it will be when browsers get 
their act together.

I'm NOT talking about switching to Java. I'm talking about building, in 
Java, the kind of future-browser that Lively is anticipating. Lie and 
cheat unabashedly. If Rhino isn't performing (and let's not forget Da 
Vinci etc) then resort to Java. If (say) SVG doesn't offer a decent RGB 
interface, add it. If SVG is too slow, revert to Java graphics. Lie and 
cheat  -but be sure to have a browser implementation on hand lest you be 
caught.

If Lively in the browser works, great  -but let users know that Java 
will give them a better user experience today, especially for complex 
worlds, and serious Lively hacking. The Internet Explorer problem goes 
away(ish), and Sun research has a  (better than) ringside view of the 
java-ajax gap.

[Aside: Silverlight would be an alternative to Java, but I'm assuming 
that Sun/Oracle remain involved and people continue to fret about their 
air supply. If Flash suddenly got a compliler on the client, it too 
would make a nice Lively incubator. ]

More metaphors: I'm aware that the project worked with Java for a while 
but encountered too much intrinsic complexity. I propose that Java be 
considered *microcode*. The problem with the browser as computer, is 
that you can't microcode it. When you hit a wall, there are no options. 
Even Mozilla starts to feel like proprietary software.

My sense would be to implement HTML Canvas in "jmicrocode" (if a 
implementation doesn't exist already). Canvas feels to me like a better 
lively substrate than SVG, and doing Canvas in Java (oops -jmicrocode) 
feels better to me than adapting to another graphics api (eg scene graph 
etc) in Lively JS directly.

Tell me I'm wrong  (it's good for me).

IMO Javascript was a much better strategic choice than Java.

The people who need to be aware of Lively are the same people who made
jQuery succeed.

I love the way Google has documented their Javascript APIs. I think
this approach would help. Very few people will want to build entire
"sites" on Lively but parts of it should be widely adopted.

Did someone mention a debugger?

Keep up the good work :-)

I'll admit to being a lurker/shirker.

Since "debugger" has come up a few times, thought I'd mention I've  
been working on WebKit's debugger, Web Inspector, for the last few  
months.  If there's something we can do to make debugging Lively  
better, I'd love to hear it.

I suspect the ability to host your own debugger isn't in the cards  
right now - perhaps something like that will be more feasible with  
Workers.  Living with the current debugger is the easiest route@the  
moment.

Peter, and all -

This is great.  This is just the kind of thinking we need to do now.

Just to let you know, this is exactly where our thinking was a year 
ago.  We got everything running on top of the JavaFX scene graph. 
This allowed us to run all the regular LK demos, but in addition Java 
(Swing) UI components in Lively windows (or not) and, hey, even a 
midi player to hook up to the PianoKeyboard.  It ran@about the 
same speed, though, because it was still all going through (our 
JavaScript emulation of) the DOM.  But Krzysztof also did a small 
experiment with direct calls on the graphics and demonstrated 
something like a 4x speedup -- I think we ran over 100 bouncing 
ellipses before slowing down to the normal speed for 25.  What a 
great strategy - runs everywhere on the Open Web, and runs much 
faster and ties into Enterprise libraries on the Sun platform.

Alas, this strategy competed with another strategy and our project 
got cancelled :-(

But it's 11 months later and people realize ours might have been good 
after all ;-)

Now to your topics...

I agree about this.  There are actually two ways to pull this off right now.
One is to take what Krzysztof did for the ellipses demo, and carry it
through to the full Morphic graphics layer.  The nice thing is that
(with a couple days' work ;-) the result could be wrapped up
as a Java Applet, and thus run in any browser where Java is available.
This would cover just about everything, including our current big
handicap, Internet Explorer.  This is the strategy I mentioned above ;-).

The other is to use the 2D canvas in O3D.  This is a very attractive
bundle since it includes not only a directly accessible canvas
library, but also the V8 JavaScript engine and full 3D if you want to
play around.

Of course these are both plugin solutions, but I think the LK story
remains clean as long as there is a full Open Web version that
remains reasonably compatible.

Yes, yes, and yes.  I think we're on the same page.

Actually, complexity was not the problem.  It's just that we felt an
Open Web solution would get us much more traction.

You and Krazy Kat, huh?  ;-)

Well, the Canvas port does exist - check it out in Safari, FireFox or Chrome at
	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/expt.xhtml
You can tell it's the real thing by evaluating
	WorldMorph.current().showDamageRectangles = true
and you will see good old JavaScript busily computing and refreshing
every damaged rectangle on the canvas.  [Of course it runs slower doing this]

So, the step to a Java applet or O3D is not that all hard to contemplate ;-)

Hi Steve (and list  -apologies if this message turns up more than once  
-am suffering email problems today)

You probably didn't read the rambling part of my post  -I don't blame you.

**I'm not suggesting that LK abandon Javascript, or browsers**. LK runs 
now (or has run, and nearly runs now) on the Java platform, using the 
Rhino Javascript engine and the Batik SVG library. A few tweaks seem to 
have been required to make it run (as for the various browsers), but 
afaik it is regular LK (yes  -lively team?).

There is no LK Java code required (Batik comes with a sample viewer that 
includes Rhino). I don't know how fast Batik is, but Rhino is almost 
certainly slower than the respectable javascript runtimes   -however 
there is an upside...

The key thing about the Rhino/Batik "browser" is that it *can be 
modified*. Sure you could modify Firefox to make it more LK friendly, 
but you would have to be able to push your changes back into Firefox to 
be meaningful.

The lieing and cheating angle involves the lie: "it runs in any 
browser"  and many cheats: (find the hot spots and optimise them in 
java  -or fix problems like the svg color api rather than living with 
them)   -whilst still preserving "don't get caught" by maintaining 
support for pure javascript on a browser. Even if took lots of java code 
it would absolutely be possible to deliver a fast, consistent Lively 
Kernel on the JRE.

Keep in mind that there is no LK support yet for IE, and that is a 
rather big hole which would be extremely hard to plug natively. If IE 
Lively will require a plugin to work, it might as well be an already 
widely deployed plugin that offers this magic cheat-ability.

Last I heard, someone on the Lively team (Krzysztof Palacz I think) was 
working on the Java version, but intriguingly  -he was using the new 
scene-graph libraries rather than Batik.  If this work has stalled, it 
would be good to know so lurkers and shirkers might give it a go.

Ok, so you may have appreciated all this Steve and and still didn't 
agree.  Fair enough :-)

You also mentioned:

 >>Very few people will want to build entire"sites" on Lively but parts

Personally, I can't see the value in using part of Lively. It's value is 
as a complete self-contained solution. I don't really want to build 
"sites" with Lively  -I want to make and share stuff on a simple little 
"virtual computer in a web page" (like an XO  -except free, and able to 
ship down a tcp/ip connection ;-)  )

Actually I did read it, but I have to confess I didn't really understand it.
Having looked@it again I realize that my problem is that I don't think of
Java as a client-side technology. JavaFX sounds nice, but it's in the same
league as Silverlight, and not likely to be available on the platforms I
want to support. JavaScript is already there, and that will be the case for
any new devices that ship in the foreseeable future.

I am impressed with the momentum and widespread adoption of Javascript, and
not quite sure how having an additional dependency on the Java runtime
helps, given the complexity web developers are already faced with (it seems
only to get worse). I don't mean this as a slight or to disrespect to the
work that's been done on Java. It's a great technology, I just don't see it
a necessary part of the browser application architecture.

[I've omitted commentary about Rhino and Batik because I'm not familiar with
those]

In general it seems like the browser world is moving towards WebKit, with
the exception of Microsoft (not sure about Mozilla). I suppose some people
still need IE, especially in big companies. I gave up on Windows as a
professional about two years ago, and this is admittedly a blind spot for
me. In any case, it seems reasonable to assume that any holes in WebKit
could be plugged with JavaScript wrappers around Microsoft-specific APIs. I
agree Java could help here.

I used the scare quotes around "sites" because I was too lazy to be specific
about the types of developers I was referring to. It seems to me that a
solution needs to address a problem. I think the crux of the matter is to
identify the types of problems Lively is well-suited to solve.

I am personally interested in mobile development, and I would like to
emphasize Dan's comments about LK running unmodified on the iPhone. While I
would love to pick up Lively and do wonderful things with it, I am faced
with the unfortunate necessity of earning a living. That leaves two options:

1) someone pays me to extend Lively as a platform in itself - presumably
this is a possibility in certain educational or large corporate
environments, but for a freelance guy with kids to put through school, not
likely

2) I find an application of the technology to solve a particular business
problem. What I mean by "business" is that some revenue model needs to
exist, if not immediately,@some point in the not too distant future. For
me the essential technology components are a fast and reliable distributed
object model with built-in configuration management. Graphics are important,
but the reason people use computers is that they are a powerful
communications tool. It doesn't have to be something for corporate drones,
but a clever social networking application that "just works" would be nice.
People who don't want to configure or program their environments should just
be able to do something useful with a nicely designed system. How can I do
that?

As an old Smalltalk guy I found it quite easy to pick up Objective-C and
start doing iPhone development. I know that this is very likely a dead-end
as far as development technologies go, but it's been fun to indulge myself
with such a slick OO environment. I worked in .NET for 5 years and never
enjoyed it. I've tried many many times to pick up Java over the years and
continually found myself frustrated by a maze of interlocking standards that
never actually helped me get things done, but instead seemed to be punishing
me for my ignorance about the latest trends in the pursuit of the holy grail
of software engineering. Lively seems fun but I need to understand how I can
be productive with it.

In the past year I learned C++ and found it not to be anywhere near as bad
as I expected (although I still prefer the looser discipline of Obj-C), and
now I'm looking@GLSL shaders and entirely new ways of writing data
parallel code for web browsers and mobile devices. What is missing with
these Old New technologies is the stuff I took for granted for 15 years with
Smalltalk - interactive inspectors, incremental method compilation,
debuggers, easy code navigation. LK offers these things, which is exciting,
but most developers are willing to forego something that makes their lives
easier if it means they can have more control over the final result, whether
that means presentation quality, performance or deployment flexibility. I
don't have to worry so much about hard crashes as I used to but often I miss
tweaking a drawing method without rebuilding my entire app.

I would like to see documentation to help me understand that Lively isn't a
large complex system with ill-defined internal dependencies. It needs to be
easy to use the parts I need without pulling in other components that are
still only partially developed, or worse, pulling in bits of framework that
are partially developed and half-forgotten. I have seen this too many times
and I worry that it's a natural consequence of "complete self-contained
solutions" that don't consider how they fit in with other components that
are also part of an even larger complex system.

This is not specific, but fairly general.  A strategy.

I believe LK should join the rapid JS revolution: server side, client  
side, and communication between the two.

Server Side: From the day of Steve Yegge's Rhino On Rails post, a  
flood of server side JS stunts have been flourishing.
   http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html
Aptana's Jaxer, with a DOM on the server side, and now Google App  
Engine supporting Rhino.  Why is this happening?  History.  Us old- 
timers are used to desktop programming.  But the *average* programmer  
is young and web centric.  Proof?  Look@Adobe's AIR which uses JS,  
CSS/HTML, DOM to create desktop apps!  Yup .. migration of web tech to  
desk tech.  And its pretty impressive.

Client Side: Yes, script kiddies have used snippets to make pages  
horrid for years.  But since the rise of brilliant JS practitioners  
(John Resig, Douglas Crockford, and more) .. including LK .. people  
recognize JS's power, simplicity, and sophistication.  The Browser has  
made JS the dominant language, period.  Its everywhere.  With Doug's  
"JS the good parts" book, snobs like me have been converted.  And  
Rhino being built into the Java release has made JS outside the  
browser popular.  Flash is JS++.  And more systems are becoming JS  
based daily. And with Chrome and other really fast JS implementations,  
performance is less and less an issue daily.

Communication: This is the sleeper: JSON.  XML was the ugly duckling  
for quite a while for client-server communication .. the X in AJAX.   
But now savvy programmers are sending JSON back & forth, needing no  
parsing .. eval the payload and you get a native JS data structure!

Libraries: I might as well include these too.  What is a JS library?   
A URL.  You simply can't have easier deployment.  And a HUGE number of  
libraries are being converted to JS.  Processing, for example now has  
a ProcessingJS (Resig).

So gone is PHP-XML-JS-Classpath and always forgetting which language  
you are using.  JS has unified the whole client-server-communication  
life cycle.  And it has turned deployment into HTTP.  This is almost  
impossible to believe!  I study Complex Adaptive Systems and this  
emergent phenomenon is hard even for me to believe!  Prisoner's  
Dilemma heck, look@the JS ecology.

This unification is important.  I built an early GAE web app, using  
Google Maps, their Big Tables, Django for the server, JS for the  
client, a bloody blend of XML and JSON, and so on.  Painful!

So what does that have to do with LK?  Strategy.  I don't know how to  
do it, but building a part of the JS ecology/revolution above would be  
absfab.  Downside: you'll now have to fit in with the rest of the  
crowd.  That is often difficult, architecturally.  How to avoid  
conflicts.  How to factor LK so that it can be used with or without  
the DOM.

But its the direction I would take.  I'd get Resig and Crockford on  
the phone and chat strategy.  I left Data Base out of the above but if  
you need to spin it for the New Sun (how's it going, btw), JS+JSON+DB  
is a great story.  It certainly not hard to convince folks XML is  
diabolic!

Best wishes,

    -- Owen

Yes, I agree.
But there is another revolution around collaboration, by which I mean
multiple users in the same space, that may be a closer match to LK's
strengths.  We should definitely encourage both for now.

Agreed.
Necessity is the mother of invention.  By which I mean that the way for
us to make progress on the server side is to have a need for the server
side.  Or, equally effective, a passion to pull of a cool demo on the
server side.

By the way, with regard to the DOM, Krzysztof's cool 1-week port of
LK to JavaFX was done by way of a JavaScript emulation of the DOM
that was originally done by Dan Amelang as a way to couple some
experimental graphics to LK.  The code is in EmuDom.js.

Yup.  Indeed, the faster JS engines are making real the characterization
of JS as the assembly language of the Internet.  It is just good enough,
and now just fast enough, to make it reasonable to compile lots of
our favorite languages to JS.

Absolutely.  I have wanted to make this shift almost since we started.
I always thought the Smalltalk approach to serialization is nice, and
JSON is an even cleaner and more consistent job.

>Libraries: I might as well include these too.  What is a JS library?

Yes.  And this is something we need to press on.  It would be so
easy to just go through our files and separate the kernel from the rest
and then crunch it into one or two simple files.

Well, it's not so amazing to me because we have a lot of pressure
going from smart people who know that it *can* be simple, and it
*can* be general, and they're all trying to figure out how to evolve
into a better world.  And guess what?  Enough smart people
with enough motivation will finally figure out how to, as you put it,
turn deployment into HTTP ;-).

>This unification is important.  I built an early GAE web app, using

This is just what I have been doing recently:  using LK in the role of
Dojo to implement a couple of views in conventional HTML.
It was Steve Uhler who pushed for this, and Robert Krahn who
built the first demo -- check out...

	http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/divChallenge.html

It's just a sketch, but it shows three Lively Kernel worlds embedded
in HTML, and inter-operating so, eg, an HTML input can control
the time zone of a clock or the number of cylinders on the engine.

So, as you see above, much of the work has been done already,
although, as with LK in general, only through proof of concept.
I agree with your strategy, plus I still want to include a couple of
other synergies (Caja and collaboration@least, plus some
high performance solution).

I've been feeling it's time to take it all apart and start over, but maybe
it's also time to put together a set of demos using what we have
to map out and demonstrate our place in the new world.
One demo I've been wanting to do (mentioned earlier) is a
truly performant port to O3D or JavaFX that can run in any
browser including (sigh) IE.

I think that including databases is relatively easy@this point.
Steve Uhler has been playing around with this, and you're absolutely
right that that's a big market, and one that I think is starved for
*lively* views.

And with regard to your "how's it going", you can read the news
as well as I regarding the high order bit.  For the LK project, it has
been rough, as I'm the only person remaining, though Robert,
Krzysztof and Steve will always lend a hand if I ask.  That's what led
me to call for workers, and it has been great just to hear voices out
there.  I think something big is coming, and I still want to play.
I agree absolutely about alignment with Crockford, Resig and,
looking forward, Mark Miller's work.

Again thanks for your strategic thoughts and your enthusiasm in general.

Hi

1.
The LK wiki seems to have been broken for a while (or is it just me?). 
Worlds fail to start.

I *think* that the problem is that getting scratch.js returns a 404 *and 
a page not found html page*  - the browser is choking on the html. I'm 
not certain this is the problem, but it is the only error in the console.


2.
I've been playing with a Lively world running in "Squiggle"  (the demo 
batik viewer).  In theory, this isn't a big deal  -Squiggle is just 
another browser that happens to be implemented in Java and doesn't 
bother with html.   In practice it was fantastic to see the radial 
engine fire up!  I don't know if it is just a win for generality,or hard 
work by the Lively team to ensure that Rhino/Batik support   -but it 
sure is cool.

Krzysztof pointed me@an url  for use with batik a while ago, but it 
threw a scary looking exception in Squiggle and I gave up. The problem 
turns out to be easily worked around   [pass the document object as xpe 
when creating the Query class  -rather than passing 
Global.XPathEvaluator (an interface in Batik apparently) or calling new 
XPathEvaluator   (fails as you are trying to instatiate an interface). 
The document implements XPathEvaluator (but I'm not sure this is the 
perfect solution)  Also, we don't seem to get the document's 
spec/location from squiggle, which causes problems when creating the URL 
class in network.js] .


If anyone feels like running Lively in java, download Batik (includes 
squiggle), start squiggle and open the 2nd URL below

original world (nearly works) at:

http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com//legacy/0.8.5/Lively.svg

hacked world (identical except for core.js and network.js in which i 
made 2 squiggle specific hacks)

*still throws an exception that i haven't  looked into  -but does start*

btw: yes, moprhing squiggle into a lively capable applet would be cool 
wouldn't it...

Hmm.  All works fine for me in Safari, FF3 and Chrome, starting at...
	http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/index.xhtml
and testing the kaleidoscope as well.  (not what you wanted to hear I know)

Usually scratch.js gets ignored without mishap.  What browser are you using?
Any possibility that something wrong is being cached?  Make sure
all caching is emptied and off@least once.

This is great to hear!  Up to now, the only way we had to hook up
to Java was Krzysztof's somewhat special hookup though emulated DOM.
Would be great to have this work along with midi for the PianoKeyboard ;-)

Hi, Pete --

Lively Wiki works in Windows with Safari for me. Chrome and Firefox  
still throw a PROPFIND error when doing certain wiki things but apart  
from that it seems to work quite well.

What problems do you observe?

Status: O

Hi Livelies

1. Is it just my imagination or is MS getting serious about IE?  A new 
VM (with radical new innovations -like tagged integers!) and a new 
graphics stack on DirectX.  I never thought it would happen (at least 
not yet,  I expected they would keep back-pedalling on IE to give 
Silverlight room).  The only missing piece from an LK perspective is 
what graphics api they will provide (surely they will have to provide 
something to replace vml -be it canvas?,svg?,xaml?).  

Maybe this "browser as general platform" idea has got some legs after 
all :-)


2. Java progress

A Batik powered applet that runs SVG/javascript turns out to be 
trivial.  There is even an example in the source distribution, and after 
a fashion, with a number of issues that I haven't looked at, and with a 
snappy start time of about 8 minutes  -it runs LK.


an example can be coaxed into almost-life@the URL below:

Well, I still think so.  The LK project has had only the scantest of resources --
really no more than 3 people and usually two working on the kernel --
and yet it could clearly be a decent application platform and a competitor
to flash (this is becoming increasingly important out in the world)
if we got serious.

With regards to the successor to VML, my money is on canvas,
but who knows.   SVG is certainly a possibility,
but my sense of the buzz these days is that canvas will be the final
winner, and my guess is the folks@MS have picked up on this as well.

Besides its simplicity relative to SVG, canvas pairs well with 3-D in
two ways:  first most 3D engines need a canvas underneath, so
you find, eg, O3D providing both a 2-D canvas  and 3-D API;
and second, the 2-D canvas provides overlays such as, eg, 
heads-up display panels, as well as a projection screen for textures.

Way to go, dude!  We used to say that, when we could print 3+4,
ninety percent of Smalltalk was working.  Well, if you can display a
running clock, I think ninety percent of LK is working.

I even managed to move it, copy it(!) and add a vertex to the second hand.
[by the way, I had trouble getting this to load a second time after
I caused an error (tried to bring up a menu)]

It would be nice if you could move forward to the new sources soon,
as various things such as the clock will look nicer, and it will be
easier to get, eg, the wiki working.

Pete, this is great!  It will be fantastic if you can push it through
to being a real IE solution.

Is anyone actively working on LK's tile scripting system these days?

When I try opening up a TileScriptingBox in the latest LK, it looks
pretty rough.

I was thinking that it might be fun to have some simple little
Javascript games for teaching people the basics of programming - build
a script to guide a robot through a maze, that sort of thing.

Hi Folks

Just when your thought the decade would pass without the chance to 
marvel@LK 9 running in an applet...

http://www.spatialmedia.com/lively/batik90r1/

Don't wait until 23:59 to hit the URL above because she takes a while

Hi

I see that ClamatoParser.txt has been added to the kernel folder. This adds
Clamato Smalltalkese to LK's OMeta parser.

It stands to reason that I should be able to print this piece of Clamato
Smalltalkese in a TextMorph:


@x := 10.


That shouldn't be undefined. It should react the same way when printed as:

x = 10.

What am I missing to make Clamato syntax work in LK?

OK, this is interesting.

I downloaded the latest Java stuff into my Mac using Software Update.
I then opened up all three browsers - Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
In the first two this exercise is a total fail. In Safari it took me seven
minutes for the clock to appear the first time and six minutes the second
time. That's better than half an hour.

I'm running JRE 6, the latest that Apple is sending out. I looked up Batik.
It's an svg framework thing for use with Apache. I looked up Rhino. It's a
JavaScript engine written by Mozilla.
I learned what the Java console was, turned it on, and here's the output:

@651>console log started

And It takes half the time for me, a mere 5 seconds, to load
anonymous_module_0. That's half the time of yours, but I don't see the point
of this metric, if the whole process takes six minutes.

I like this investigation, and I'm learning things here. But I don't see the
point of running LK in an applet.

And "scratch is running" (at @200648) What is that? I've been looking at
Scratch, the Squeak app for kids today, so is that it? Or is it some Java
thing?

... actually, I looked@the error log in my locally deployed LK, and it
references an attempt to download a file called Scratch.js. There is no such
file in the downloaded source files. But, in index.xhtml there is an attempt
to load a file called that. I guess it ignores the fact that it can't find
it.

Naw, that can't be it. How can "scratch be running" if there is no scratch
file in the source code to run?

For me it's 2-3 times slower (dual core 2.4GHz)

The one, the only reason to my thinking, is to get LK running in Internet Explorer.
If we had a practical (this is not yet) version of LK running in Internet Explorer
(and other places like Opera, etc),
we would have a much better story for real adoption.
What Peter has done is great, and it would be wonderful to be able to show all
the LK demos in IE.  More to the point, people could then start publishing
real web content in LK knowing that everyone could see it.

There are a couple of other paths to this same goal.

One is the Renesis SVG plugin that runs in IE.  We got that *almost* working a year
ago, but there are difficulties with JavaScript compatibility as well.

In my opinion, the most promising approach@this point is to use Google's O3D
plugin with the canvas version of LK.  This has the sterling side-effect of bringing
along the V8 JS engine as well.  It also has the enticing side-effect of leaving
real 3-D just a few function calls away, once it is running.

Anyone feel like trying this?  I feel bad that I haven't already, but I'm distracted right now.

No connection to Scratch the Squeak app.  Scratch.js is just a file name we
use for simple experiments -- if it's there it will be loaded; if not it will be ignored.

Dunno about the "is running" message.

Hi, Chris --

The version of the Smalltalk parser in the wiki was old. I updated it from the repository. However, in order to work SmalltalkParser.js has to be loaded. If you do module('lively.SmalltalkParser').load() and (when it is loaded) evaluate Smalltalk expressions it should work.

Try for example http://livelykernel.sunlabs.com/repository/lively-wiki/rk-stExample.xhtml :-)

Best,
Robert

I consistently get less than 5 minutes for startup in Firefox on Ubuntu for
the Batik LK applet.  During that time, CPU use is only moderate, so perhaps
it could be drastically cut by using pack 200.
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/deployment/deployment-guide/pack200.html

Also, I though I heard about a Java2D based version in one of the videos.
That seems like a great way to improve speed and decrease startup time.
Does anyone have a feel for how much work is required to get that
functional?

OK  -I'll bite...


Curt seems to be daring someone to splutter.. "but LK *is* a development environment environment  -why would you want anything else?"  -so I won't fall into that trap (instead, i throw myself into it below)  Besides, personally I find LK a bit raw for programming  -and "ajax IDEs" (ie Java or C# IDE's re-purposed for javascript) a bit too dead. 

I find myself grasping for something in the middle, hence in part my interest in running LK on Java.

As an analogy, think about how effective Firebug is, being built into the browser. I'm not discounting Firebug for LK development (and perhaps a Firefox extension for LK 'development' is a good idea...), but Java seems to offer even more opportunity for getting down under then hood of the browser (whilst still having a practical deployment path)
 


[wink-ON] 

For a development environment, first you will require a worldview where we separate "users" and "developers".  Developers will require the usual aeroplane cockpit style IDE.  Users will simply need to be docile and run an emasculated netbook, preferably one provisioned exclusively by a single app store. This device need not have much in the way of a processor because any computation they could ever require is obviously best done in THE CLOUD.

Hi Chris

it sounds a little like java hasn't been installed for Chrome and 
Firefox   -can you run stuff@sun.java.com ( or 
http://www.spatialmedia.com/misc/JSniff.htm )?

 >>
In Safari it took me seven
minutes for the clock to appear the first time and six minutes the second
time. That's better than half an hour.

<<

Interesting.

The half hour thing is something of a curiosity@the moment -and my 
working assumption is that this is all about whether Rhino optimization 
runs.
I was getting 8 minute-ish startup using a slightly older Batik version 
-but to run LK9.0 I needed to make some minor changes to the Batik-Rhino 
interface and use a newer Rhino (for the JS 1.5 stuff in LK9.0).

I know that batik/Rhino *can* start LK in comparable time to browsers 
(because Batik Squiggle does so). When I get some time to work on this 
some more, I'll put together a package with "an LK9.0 capable squiggle".



 >>
I like this investigation, and I'm learning things here. But I don't see the
point of running LK in an applet.
<<

The obvious win would be to provide a solution (albeit involving a 
plugin) for IE users. Current IE lacks SVG or Canvas, and the javascript 
is very slow (but the latter@least is going to change -MS are working 
on a "v8 like" javascript engine).

For me, the real appeal of IE is to act as a safety net. LK on browsers 
is a thrilling high-wire act -if you should trip (ie if the browser 
won't do the job) there is no net to catch you. With java, you@least 
have options (ie a safety net). You can "fix" the browser and still 
deploy (as per my earlier post on the general list today)

 >>
And "scratch is running" (at @200648) What is that? I've been looking at
Scratch, the Squeak app for kids today, so is that it? Or is it some Java
thing?
<<

No -it isn't *that* scratch (sadly) afaik. In fact, it was missing (and 
is optional), but Batik was choking on the lack of it, so rather than 
remove it from the script declarations I provided a 'hello i am running' 
implementation.




regards
Pete

Hi Robert,

Thank you for the details and the link. I see how the pieces fit together
now. I've found the repository,
and so can see how you evolved the code into a loadable module.

This is a really cool creation. I sort of couldn't believe that you could
execute Smalltalk code and JavaScript
in the same environment, but now that I see it, and I know a bit about OMeta
I say "Of course it works that way!"

Great stuff. I plan to dig into it more.

Thanks,
Chris

1. MS and SVG. 

A sign!  It's a sign!


2. MS and Javascript

here are two interviews that are fun to listen to back to back...

exhibit a) 

Lars Bak (V8) lecturing microsoft on how to build a fast javascript engine

http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Expert-to-Expert-Erik-Meijer-and-Lars-Bak-Inside-V8-A-Javascript-Virtual-Machine/?Page=1


exhibit b)

The MS people, who it seems were already doing that work@the time.

http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/IE-9-First-look-at-the-new-JS-Engine/


-i imagine that the Self fans on this list would roll their eyes over 
both   -but all very exiting for LK!



3. Google Chrome Frame

Has anyone tried LK on this beast?

There was a Firefox ActiveX control that did the same thing, beack in 
the FF2 days    -but it didn't make it to FF3 (although the developer 
mentioned somewhere that it would be easier to do in ff3). Perhaps it 
will come back now, and provide yet another option for IE.

One of my siblings recently purchased a Cricut personal cutting machine.
It's similar to a printer except it cuts out shapes instead. Just think it's
potentially relevant to Lively and it's morphs. And I can't wait to run
Lively on the new Apple device with multi-touch.
