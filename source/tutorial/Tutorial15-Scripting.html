    All the objects in Lively Kernel can be scripted using <i>timers</i>.
    Timers are JavaScript functions that are invoked periodically for the given objects.<br>
    For instance, in the example below we are using timers to rotate a number of
    stars that have been defined as <i>PolygonShape</i> objects.<br>
    We have also created a clock that moves and rotates itself as it ticks.
    See the <a href="Tutorial15-Scripting.js">source code of this demo</A> for details.

    Notes:<ul>
    <li>All the usual object editing capabilities can be applied to timed objects.
    For instance, you can edit the text in the labels below, or reshape the polygons on the fly.
    </ul>

    <b>Try it yourself!</b> Take a look at the <a href="Tutorial15-Scripting.js">source code</a>
    of this demo to see how to create scripted objects.  <br>While looking at the demo
    in action, try editing the text labels as well as grabbing the handles
    of the stars while the stars are rotating.
