    In addition to the features discussed in the earlier sections of this
    tutorial, there are a number of additional features that have not been
    mentioned yet.  Such features include: <ul>
    <li><i>turn fisheye on/off</i>: For every object in the system you can 
    enable a <i>fisheye</i> feature that will automatically enlarge and shrink
    the object based on the proximity of the mouse cursor.  Apart from changing
    the size of the object, this feature has no other particular purpose.<p>
    <li><i>reset rotation/scaling</i>: These menu operations allow the rotation
    and scaling factors to be easily reset back to their original values.<p> 
    <li><i>put me in a window/tab/in the open open</i>: These experimental
    features allow you to easily place any object inside a window, or remove
    the window from around the contents of the window.<p>
    <li><i>use debug background</i>: This world menu operation makes the
    background of the world <i>transparent</i>, allowing you to see the debug
    console of the web browser. (Note: To enable the debug console, you
    may have to tweak your browser settings or enable the debug console
    explicitly from the HTML file that starts to the system.)<p>
    <li>In addition to the features discussed above, there are many
    other features that are still experimental at this point. </ul>
