    You can "glue" objects to each other to create composite objects.
    For instance, the object below has been created by reshaping the
    green ellipse, red rectangle and black line, and then dragging the
    objects onto the green ellipse.

    Notes:<ul>
    <li>The exact location for object composition is determined by mouse location.
    To attach an object to another object, the mouse must be inside the other
    object when the mouse button is released.
    <li>The entire composite object can be moved by grabbing the bottommost
    object with the mouse.
    <li>Parts can be removed from a composite object by grabbing the object
    that you want to remove.</ul>

    <b>Try it yourself!</b> Try to create the face-like image yourself.
    Once you are done, try moving the entire composite object by grabbing
    the green ellipse.  After this, break the composite image apart by
    moving its components away from the green ellipse.
