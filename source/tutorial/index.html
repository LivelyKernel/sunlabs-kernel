    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <i>Lively Kernel</i> a novel web programming environment developed by
    <i>Project Flair</i> at Sun Microsystems Labs.  The main goal of Lively Kernel
    is to bring the same kind of simplicity, generality and flexibility to web
    programming that we have known in desktop programming for thirty years,
    but without the installation and upgrade hassles than conventional
    desktop applications have.
    <p>
    A key difference between Lively Kernel and other systems in the same area 
    is our focus on uniformity.  Our goal is to build a platform
    using a minimum number of underlying technologies.  This is in contrast
    with many current web technologies that utilize a diverse array of
    technologies such as HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, PHP, XML, and so on.
    In Lively Kernel we attempt to do as much as possible using a 
    single technology: <i>JavaScript</i>. We have chosen JavaScript primarily
    because of its ubiquitous availability in the web browsers today
    and because of its syntactic similarity to other highly popular
    languages such as C, C++ and Java.  However, we also want to leverage
    the dynamic aspects of JavaScript, especially the ability to modify
    applications at runtime. Such capabilities are an essential ingredient
    in building a malleable web programming environment that allows
    applications to be developed interactively and collaboratively.
    <p>
    Lively Kernel places a special emphasis on treating web applications
    as real <i>applications</i>, as opposed to the document-oriented nature of
    most web applications today. In general, we want to put <i>programming</i>
    into web development, as opposed to the current weaving of HTML
    and XML documents that is also sometimes referred to as programming.
    <p>
    The Lively Kernel system runs in an ordinary web browser. 
    The system utilizes the JavaScript engine, graphics capabilities
    and asynchronous networking features that are already available
    in commercial web browsers today.  In general, one of our goals
    has been to leverage existing technologies whenever possible.
    <p>
    A unique feature of the Lively Kernel system is a graphics
    library called <i>Morphic</i>.  Morphic is a user interface
    framework that supports composable graphical objects,
    along with the machinery required to display and animate these
    objects, handle user inputs, and manage underlying system resources
    such as displays, fonts and color maps.  A key goal of Morphic
    is to make it easy to construct and edit interactive graphical objects,
    both by direct manipulation and from within programs.
    The Morphic user interface framework was originally developed for the 
    <a href="http://research.sun.com/self/">Self</a> system
    at Sun Labs, but it became popular later also as part of
    the <A href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a> Smalltalk environment.
    Lively Kernel brings the flexibility and power of this user interface
    framework to web application development.
