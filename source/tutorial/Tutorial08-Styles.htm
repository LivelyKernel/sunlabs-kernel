    The visual attributes of each object in the system can be 
    manipulated easily.  For every object, you can use its
    popup menu to open a <i>style panel</i>.<br>
    The style panel allows you to change, e.g., 
    the border width, border color, fill color/pattern as
    well as the opacity of the object.<br>
    For text objects, you can also change the font and font size.

    Notes:<ul>
    <li>You can also change the visual attributes of the world itself
    by opening a style panel from the popup menu of the world
    (background of the display).
    <li>You can modify the styles of multiple objects simultaneously
    by opening a style panel for a selection tray.
    <li>You can also open a style panel for a style panel (!) to manipulate
    the look and feel of the panel itself.

    <b>Try it yourself!</b> Try changing the various visual attributes
    of the red rectangle using the style panel.  Try using different
    gradient colors as well as opacity levels.<br>
    Note: Currently opacity works only with simple fills, not with
    gradient fills or stipple patterns.
