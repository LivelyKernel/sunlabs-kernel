    Notes:<ul>
    <li>Since all the graphical objects in this game have been implemented as morphs,
    you can flexibly move objects around.
    <li>For instance, you can move the radar view outside the actual game window, or pick up the status bars and move them to a different location.</ul>

    to start the game.<br>
    Use the arrow keys to navigate through the maze.<br>
    Try to find all the blue walls, and steer yourself through all of them
