    Lively Kernel has a convenient "<i>drill</i>" feature that allows you to 
    analyze ("take a core sample of") the visual hierarchy of the objects
    that have been laid on top of each other, and access any of those objects
    easily.  When you use the "<i>drill</i>" menu operation for an object,
    the system opens a <i>drill menu</i> that visualizes the different
    layers of objects under the object that you just clicked, starting
    from the bottommost object to the topmost object (= the object itself).
    <p>
    For instance, if you use the "<i>drill</i>" operation to view the 
    hierarchy of the upper left panel of a class browser (see the screen
    snapshots below), you get a <i>drill menu</i> object that shows
    you the layers of objects in that panel, starting from the 
    bottommost object (in this case: a <i>WindowMorph</i>) to the
    topmost object (in this case: a <i>CheapListMorph</i>)
    <p>
    When you choose any of the objects in the drill menu, the system opens
    a regular popup menu that allows you to manipulate that particular object directly,
    even though that object is not necessarily topmost on the screen.
    Using this feature you can, e.g., open an inspector or a style panel to edit
    the properties of objects that are deep down in the visual hierarchy.
    <p>
    Additionally, you can use a special "<i>grab</i>" menu operation to pick up objects
    that are not topmost on the screen, e.g., to move an entire panel with its contents
    away from its current location.

    <b>Try it yourself!</b> Use the "<i>drill</i>"" and "<i>grab</i>" menu operations to 
    pick up various (layers of) objects in the the class browser shown below.
