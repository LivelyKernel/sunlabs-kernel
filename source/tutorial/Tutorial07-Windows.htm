    Lively Kernel supports windows that behave
    much like windows in conventional desktop operating systems.
    Windows are distinguished from other objects in the system
    by the presence of a <i>title bar</i>.  The title bar contains the
    name of the window as well as some <i>window control buttons</i>
    to close or collapse the window (red and yellow buttons, respectively),
    as well as to open the popup menu of the window (blue button).
    Window controls have <i>balloon help</i> to summarize the behavior
    of each control.

    Notes:<ul>
    <li>A window can be moved by grabbing it from the title bar.
    <li>A window can be resized or rotated using the handles in its corners.<p>
    <li>Pressing the red <i>Close</i> button will close the window.
    <li>Pressing the yellow <i>Collapse</i> button once will collapse
    the window.  Pressing the collapse button another time will
    restore/expand the window.  <br>Note that a collapsed window can be moved
    independently of the normal location of the window on the screen.
    <li>The blue <i>Menu</i> button opens a menu that allows the contents
    of the window to be manipulated.
    </ul>

    <b>Try it yourself!</b> Move the window around by grabbing its title bar.
    Try out the menus and the collapse/expand functionality.  <br>Furthermore,
    try rotating and resizing the window. Finally,
    close the window by pressing its <i>Close</i> button.<p>
    Note that all the objects inside the Sun 3D logo below are
    full-fledged objects that you can manipulate directly.
