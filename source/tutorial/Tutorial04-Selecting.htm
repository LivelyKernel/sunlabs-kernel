    To select multiple objects simultaneously, you can use 
    a <i>selection tray</i>.  A selection tray is created by
    dragging the mouse (while keeping the mouse button down)
    around the objects that you want to select.

    Notes:<ul>
    <li>Once a selection tray has been created, you can move the selected
    objects by grabbing the background of the selection tray.
    <li>You can manipulate the objects in the selection tray also
    by utilizing the handles of the selection tray.  <br>For instance,
    to rotate or enlarge all the objects inside the selection tray,
    press the <i>Alt</i> or <i>Alt+Shift</i> keys, respectively,
    while grabbing a handle of the selection tray. </ul>
